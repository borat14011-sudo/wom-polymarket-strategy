### SHORT #1: "How to Order Tapas Like a Local (Not a Tourist)"

**📊 YOUTUBE METADATA**

**Title (SEO):** "How to Order Tapas in Madrid - Local Secret Nobody Tells Tourists 🇪🇸"

**Description:**
```
First time ordering tapas in Madrid? You're probably doing it WRONG! 😅

Here's the secret method locals use (and why pointing at random dishes actually WORKS):

✅ Never order more than 2-3 tapas per person
✅ Look at what locals are eating and say "LO MISMO"
✅ Point at dishes and say "UNO MÁS"
✅ Every bar has a specialty - ask "¿Cuál es su especialidad?"

Pro tip: Spanish people LOVE when you copy their orders. It's the ultimate compliment!

Filming location: Traditional tapas bars in Madrid's La Latina neighborhood

### SHORT #5: "Baby Nap Schedule vs Spanish Meal Times (IMPOSSIBLE)"

**📊 YOUTUBE METADATA**

**Title (SEO):** "Trying to Sync Baby Naps with Spanish Meal Times... THIS IS WAR ⚔️"

My baby naps at 1 PM. Spain eats lunch at 2 PM. 

THERE IS NO OVERLAP. 😤

THE PROBLEM:
👶 Baby schedule: Naps at 10 AM, 1 PM, 4 PM
🇪🇸 Spanish meals: Breakfast 9 AM, Lunch 2 PM, Dinner 10 PM

3 SURVIVAL OPTIONS:

Option 1: EMBRACE CHAOS
- Feed baby at noon (grocery store pouches)
- You eat lunch at 3 PM
- Everyone cranky, but you ate paella ✅

Option 2: TOURIST SCHEDULE
- Eat at "tourist times" (1 PM / 8 PM)
- Locals judge you
- Baby is happy
- Choose: Authenticity OR sleep 😅

Option 3: BORAT METHOD (what we did)
- Family siesta 2-4 PM
- Wake up at 5 PM
- Park until 9 PM (Spanish kids play late!)
- Late dinner at 10 PM (baby sleeps in stroller)
- Become vampire family 🦇

We chose Option 3. Now we're nocturnal. But we're HAPPY nocturnal people with jamón!

Madrid's beautiful 400-year-old streets weren't designed for strollers 😅

Here are the SMOOTH paths that won't shake your baby like an earthquake:

🌳 Retiro Park - Fully paved, wide paths, ZERO bumps
🏛️ Paseo del Prado - Museum mile, wheelchair accessible = stroller heaven
🛍️ Gran Vía - Modern sidewalks, gentle slopes
💎 Salamanca neighborhood - Rich people sidewalks = SMOOTH

❌ AVOID OR DIE:
🏰 La Latina (old town) - Medieval cobblestones of doom
📍 Plaza Mayor area - Bumpy + crowded = baby revolt
🗺️ Streets called "Calle de..." - Old = charming = wheel torture

LIFE HACK: Turn on Google Maps wheelchair accessibility mode. It shows smooth routes!

Emergency solution: Baby carrier (BabyBjörn). Your back hurts, but baby is happy 🎒

GRANDMA'S MADRID RATINGS:

🍴 FOOD: 9/10
"Jamón is good. Wine is cheap. But dinner at 10 PM? I'm ASLEEP. Why do Spanish people hate sleep?"

👥 PEOPLE: 10/10  
"Very loud, but friendly. They LOVE babies. Random metro woman tried to feed my great-grandson a cookie. I allowed it. Cookie was good."

🎨 MUSEUMS: 7/10
"Too many Jesus paintings. I counted 47 in one hour at the Prado. I GET IT, he was popular."

🚶 WALKING: 3/10
"Everything is uphill. My knees are 71 years old. Madrid is a YOUNG PERSON city. Bring ibuprofen."

🚽 BATHROOMS: 2/10
"Why are toilets so small? Why is toilet paper like sandpaper? Why do bars have NO bathrooms? I have QUESTIONS."

⭐ OVERALL: 8.5/10
"I complain, but I had good time. Would come again. But next time, we rent wheelchair for cobblestones. My knees cannot do another Palacio Real stairs."

FINAL VERDICT: Madrid is great for families, terrible for knees. Bring comfortable shoes and low expectations for toilet paper quality.

(She walked 15,000 steps that day and lived to complain about it 😂)
