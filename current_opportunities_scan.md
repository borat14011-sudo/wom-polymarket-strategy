## Top 3 High-Conviction Opportunities

### 🥇 #1: Trump Deportations 250k-500k (YES)
**Market:** Will Trump deport 250,000-500,000 people in 2025?  
**Current Price:** 89.05% YES | 10.95% NO

**Liquidity:** $7,354  
**Days to Resolution:** ~322 days (Dec 31, 2025)

- 4% transaction costs (2% entry + 2% exit)
- Assuming 70% true probability:
  - **Net Expected Value:** +8.2%
  - **Annualized Return:** +9.3%

**Position Sizing:**
- Kelly Criterion: 12.5% of capital
