## 💰 ESTIMATED RETURNS (STRATEGY #7)

**Conservative Assumptions:**
- Win Rate: 75% (lower than claimed 85%)
- Avg Return: +20% per winning trade
- Avg Loss: -15% per losing trade
- Frequency: 2 trades/week (100/year)
- Position Size: 10% of bankroll

**Expected Annual Performance:**
- Wins: 75 trades × +20% × 10% = +150%
- Losses: 25 trades × -15% × 10% = -37.5%
- **Net Return:** +112.5% annual

**Risk Metrics (Estimated):**
- Max Drawdown: ~25% (if 3-4 losses in a row)
- Sharpe Ratio: ~2.5 (high return per unit risk)
- Correlation to other strategies: LOW (insider info ≠ price momentum)

## 🎯 INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING STRATEGIES

**Correlation Analysis (Expected):**

| Strategy | Correlation | Diversification Benefit |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| NO-side bias | LOW (0.2) | ✅ High |

| Pairs trading | LOW (0.1) | ✅ High |
| Trend filter | LOW (0.2) | ✅ High |
| Time horizon | LOW (0.1) | ✅ High |
