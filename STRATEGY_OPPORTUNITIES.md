| **Time Horizon** | Launch by June 30, 2026 |
| **Edge Rating** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH |

Market pricing 65% for $1B+ FDV is **significantly underpriced**. MegaETH is a high-performance L2 with:
- $30M+ in funding from Dragonfly, Variant, etc.

- Current implied probability: 65%
- Edge: +15-20%
- **Expected Return: +23% to +31%**

**Risk Assessment:**
- **LOW-MEDIUM** - Token launch uncertainty exists but pedigree is strong
- Launch delay risk (resolves No if no launch by June 30, 2026)
- Market condition risk (if crypto crashes before launch)

**Recommended Position:** 
- **Yes at 65% or lower**
- Position size: **5-8% of bankroll**
- Add on any dips below 60%

| **Volume** | $3M |
| **Category** | Crypto / Pre-Market |
| **Time Horizon** | Launch by Dec 31, 2026 |
| **Edge Rating** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH |

**Thesis:**
OpenSea is the **dominant NFT marketplace** with proven product-market fit:
- $13B+ in all-time volume

**Expected Return Calculation:**
- True probability estimate: 85-90%
- Current implied probability: 74%
- Edge: +11-16%
- **Expected Return: +15% to +22%**

**Risk Assessment:**
- **LOW** - Established product, just tokenizing

| **Volume** | $74K |
| **Category** | Geopolitics |
| **Time Horizon** | Dec 31, 2026 |
| **Edge Rating** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ HIGH |

**Thesis:**
Market is **overpricing diplomatic failure** at 54% No:
- Trump administration has shown openness to negotiations
- Iran's economy is crippled; they need sanctions relief
- Current tensions (Israel strikes) actually increase need for deal

- Edge: +14-19%
- **Expected Return: +30% to +41%**

**Risk Assessment:**

### 4. Bitcoin Reaches $80K in February 2026
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Current Odds** | Yes: 36% / No: 64% |
| **Volume** | $39M (aggregate across levels) |
| **Category** | Crypto / Price Prediction |
| **Time Horizon** | Feb 28, 2026 |
| **Edge Rating** | ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM-HIGH |

**Thesis:**
Market underpricing BTC upside in a **post-ETF, institutional adoption era**:
- Current BTC price ~$97K (Feb 2025) - wait, this needs checking
- Looking at the market structure, $80K seems far from current prices
- Actually, market implies significant downside risk
- If current price is near $70K range, $80K is 14% move - doable

**Correction:** Market shows BTC $70K-72K range at 44% probability, suggesting current price is around there.

**Expected Return Calculation:**
- If current BTC ~$70K, $80K = +14%
- In current bullish macro, 36% seems slightly low
- True probability estimate: 42-45%
- Edge: +6-9%
- **Expected Return: +10% to +16%**

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MEDIUM** - Crypto volatility is extreme
- Macro shocks (Fed hawkishness, recession fears)

|-----------|-------|
| **Current Odds** | Yes: 78% / No: 22% |
| **Volume** | $4M |
| **Category** | Sports |
| **Time Horizon** | Feb 22, 2026 |
| **Edge Rating** | ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM |

**Thesis:**
Norway is the **dominant Winter Olympics nation** historically:
- 2022 Beijing: 16 gold medals (2nd place Germany had 12)
- 2018 PyeongChang: 14 gold medals
- Winter sports are culturally embedded in Norway
- 78% seems **appropriately priced** but US at 17% is steal

**Better Play: US at 17%**
- True probability: 12-15%
- Market: 17%
- Actually slight negative edge

**Stick with Norway as hedge/value:**
- If Norway odds drift to 70-72%, strong value
- 78% is fair, not great

**Expected Return Calculation:**
- Wait for better entry
- If Norway at 72%: +8% edge

### 7. Kenneth Walker III Wins Super Bowl LX MVP

|-----------|-------|
| **Current Odds** | Yes: 87% / No: 13% |
| **Volume** | $12M |
| **Category** | Sports / NFL |
| **Time Horizon** | Feb 8, 2026 (TONIGHT) |
| **Edge Rating** | ⭐⭐⭐ MEDIUM |

**Thesis:**
Wait - this market seems to show **87% for Kenneth Walker III** which is EXTREMELY high for any single player:
- MVP is historically unpredictable
- QBs win ~55% of Super Bowl MVPs
- RB winning MVP is rare
- 87% implies near-certainty

**Analysis:**
This appears to be a **data artifact or market manipulation**. No RB should be 87% to win MVP pre-game.
- If accurate: Massive overpricing
- True probability: 15-20% max for any RB
- Edge: **-67% to -72%** (DO NOT BET YES)

**The Real Play:**
- **NO at 13%** represents massive value
- True probability of Walker NOT winning: 80-85%
- Market offering 13% (7.7x payout)
- **Expected Return: +500% to +550%**

**Risk Assessment:**
- **MEDIUM** - If Seahawks win and Walker has huge game, he could win
- Game script dependent
- Resolves tonight

**Recommended Position:**
- **NO at 13% or higher**
- Position size: **3-5% of bankroll**
- High conviction statistical edge

| **Volume** | $2M |
| **Category** | Crypto / Pre-Market |
| **Time Horizon** | Launch date TBD |
