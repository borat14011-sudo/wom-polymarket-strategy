## STRATEGY DEATHS (KILL SIGNALS)

### BASELINE_FIXED - KILLED
- **Death Rate:** 59.0% (590/1000 simulations)
- **Primary Death Cause:** Low Sharpe ratio (< 0.1)
- **Issue:** Insufficient risk-adjusted returns
- **Median Return:** +3.9% (not worth the risk)
- **Recommendation:** DO NOT USE

## VIABLE STRATEGIES (PASSED)

### 1. HIGH_ACCURACY_FILTER - BEST RISK-ADJUSTED
**Parameters:**
- Whale accuracy: 75%
- Slippage: 2%
- Sizing: Signal-scaled
- Base position: $150
- Signal threshold: 0.6
- Min volume: $100k

**Performance:**
- Median Return: +19.8%
- 5th Percentile: +8.7% (worst realistic case)
- 95th Percentile: +29.6%
- Median Drawdown: 2.6%
- Max Observed DD: 8.7%
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.48 (median)
- Probability of Profit: 99.9%
- Death Rate: 1.4%

**Verdict:** Best overall strategy. Highest Sharpe, lowest death rate.

---

### 2. AGGRESSIVE_KELLY - HIGHEST RETURNS
**Parameters:**
- Whale accuracy: 70%
- Slippage: 1.5%
- Sizing: Kelly criterion

## KEY FINDINGS

### What Matters Most:
1. **Whale Accuracy > 65%** - Below this, Sharpe drops below acceptable threshold
2. **Slippage Control < 2%** - Critical for profitability
3. **Signal Threshold > 0.4** - Filters noise, improves win rate
4. **Position Sizing** - Kelly > Signal-scaled > Fixed for returns, but increases DD

### Death Conditions That Killed Strategies:
- Sharpe ratio < 0.1 (BASELINE_FIXED killed by this)
- Low whale accuracy (58%) causes inconsistent returns
- High variance without sufficient return compensation

### Risk Metrics Summary:

| Metric | HIGH_ACCURACY | AGGRESSIVE_KELLY | OPTIMIZED_KIMI25 |
|--------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Sharpe (mean) | 0.50 | 0.35 | 0.29 |
| Sortino (mean) | 0.41 | 0.32 | 0.27 |
| Calmar (mean) | 8.58 | 8.42 | 6.25 |
| Return StdDev | 6.3% | 23.3% | 6.0% |
| VaR 5% | +8.7% | +24.2% | +5.9% |

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**For Production Use:**

1. **PRIMARY:** HIGH_ACCURACY_FILTER
   - Best Sharpe ratio (0.48)
   - Lowest death rate (1.4%)
   - Strong returns (+19.8% median)
   - Low drawdowns (2.6% median)

2. **ALTERNATIVE:** AGGRESSIVE_KELLY
   - If higher returns needed
   - Accept higher drawdowns (9% median)
   - Best for risk-tolerant allocation

**AVOID:**
- BASELINE_FIXED (killed - 59% death rate)
- Any strategy with whale accuracy < 65%
- Any strategy with expected Sharpe < 0.2
