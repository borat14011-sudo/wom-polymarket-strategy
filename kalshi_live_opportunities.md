## Key Observations

### Market Limitations:
1. **No Near-Term Markets**: All visible markets resolve 2045-2099
2. **API Limitations**: Data appears truncated, may not show all markets
3. **Long Timeframes**: Capital tied up for decades in most positions

### Best Opportunities Given Constraints:
1. **KXNEWPOPE-70-PPAR**: Best mean reversion play (-33% weekly drop)
2. **KXELONMARS-99**: Best liquidity play (88k volume)
3. **KXWARMING-50**: Only market in ideal 20-80% price range

### Trading Strategy Adjustments:
Given the long timeframes, consider:
1. **Smaller position sizes** (0.25% instead of 0.5%)
2. **Focus on liquidity** for easier exit if needed
3. **Monitor for new markets** with shorter timeframes
