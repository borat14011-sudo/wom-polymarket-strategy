# Google Drive Upload Alternatives

Since browser extension isn't attached, here are 3 ways to publish your presentation:

## Option 1: GitHub Pages (RECOMMENDED - Instant)

Your workspace is already a GitHub repo. Let's publish there:

```bash
# Convert markdown to HTML for web viewing
# Then push to GitHub Pages
```

**Result:** https://borat14011-sudo.github.io/trading-strategy-presentation

## Option 2: Netlify Drop (Drag & Drop)

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag the presentation file
3. Get instant shareable link

**Result:** https://random-name.netlify.app (instant, no signup required)

## Option 3: File.io (Temporary Sharing)

Upload file, get shareable link that works for 14 days.
