## 💡 REVENUE OPTIMIZATION TIPS

### Tip 1: 80/20 Rule
- 80% of revenue comes from 20% of your efforts
- Find your top 2-3 streams → DOUBLE DOWN
- Kill streams that earn <$100/month (not worth time)

### Tip 2: Increase Prices Annually
- Inflation exists
- Your experience increases
- Your audience grows
- Raise rates 10-20% each year

### Tip 3: Productize Your Time
- 1-on-1 coaching: Trade time for money (doesn't scale)
- Group coaching: Better (1 hour serves 10-20 people)
- Course: Best (1 hour of work = infinite buyers)
- **Shift from left to right as you grow**

### Tip 4: Recurring > One-Time
- $47/month membership = $564/year per member
- $497 one-time course = $497 once
- **Recurring revenue is more valuable** (predictable, compounds)

### Tip 5: Bundle Everything
- Single product: $27
- Bundle of 3 products: $47 (feels like deal)
- Same effort, 74% more revenue

## 🚨 REVENUE MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Mistake 1: Focusing on Followers Over Engagement
- 100K followers × 1% engagement = 1,000 engaged people
- 10K followers × 10% engagement = 1,000 engaged people
- **Same revenue potential!**

### Mistake 2: Undercharging
- "I'm small, so I'll charge $50"
- Reality: Your time is valuable
- Charge based on VALUE delivered, not follower count

### Mistake 3: Relying on One Income Stream
- Platform changes algorithm → your income crashes
- Diversify: Aim for 3-5 active streams

### Mistake 4: Not Tracking Numbers
- Can't optimize what you don't measure
- Track: Revenue per stream, conversion rates, traffic sources

### Mistake 5: Trying to Do Everything
- Delegating feels expensive
- But your time is MOST EXPENSIVE resource
- Hire editor = You get 10 hours back = 10 more hours to create/sell
