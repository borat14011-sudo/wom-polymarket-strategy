## Overall Recommendation

- **Validated Strategies:** 1/5
- **Profitable Strategies (>55% win rate):** 4/5

**RECOMMENDATION: NEEDS TUNING** - Strategies are profitable but differ from expectations.

## Important Notes

1. **Data Limitations:** Backtests use resolved markets but lack historical price data for precise entry timing
2. **Transaction Costs:** Not modeled in this validation (typically 2-5%)
3. **Sample Size:** Some strategies have limited matching markets
4. **Forward Testing:** Real-world results may vary - paper trading recommended

## Next Steps

1. For validated strategies: Begin paper trading with real-time data
2. For failed strategies: Refine criteria or abandon
3. Build historical price database for more accurate backtesting
4. Monitor win rates in live trading and adjust
