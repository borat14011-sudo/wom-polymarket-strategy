# Comparison Summary
# -----------------
# Theoretical Claim: 60-70% win rate
# Real Data Result: 100% win rate (1 trade)
# 
# Why the discrepancy?
# 1. Sample size: Only 1 trade vs theoretical projection
# 2. Selection bias: This market showed strong mean reversion
# 3. Open position: Trade not closed yet, could reverse
# 4. Time period: Only 7 days of data tested
#
# Expected Reality (with more testing):
# - Win rate: 50-60% (lower than theory)
# - Avg PnL: 5-15% (much lower than this 173% outlier)
# - After fees/slippage: -2-5pp reduction
#
# Conclusion:
# Cannot validate 60-70% claim with only 1 trade
# Need 20+ trades across multiple markets and time periods
# Initial signal is positive but statistically meaningless
