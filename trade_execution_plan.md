## STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION

### Option A: Manual Execution (Recommended)
1. **Open browser** and go to: https://polymarket.com/event/will-trump-deport-250000-500000-people

### Option B: Browser Automation (If Manual Fails)

But these require wallet configuration which has issues.

## TRADE RATIONALE

### Why This Trade?
1. **Market Overconfidence:** 88% YES price for 250-500k deportations is extreme
2. **Historical Context:** Obama deported ~3M over 8 years (375k/year average)
3. **Implementation Challenges:** Legal battles, logistics, political opposition
4. **Trump's Actual Record:** First term deportations were below 250k/year
5. **Probability Estimate:** Realistic chance is 40-60%, not 88%

### Risk/Reward
- **Max Loss:** $2.50 (0.5% of $500 total capital, 25% of $10 test capital)
- **Potential Gain:** $18.30 if correct (733% ROI)
- **Expected Value:** ~$10.00 (400% expected ROI)
