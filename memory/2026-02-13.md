## 🎯 WOM'S ACTUAL STRATEGY PREFERENCE (Feb 13)

**NOT interested in longshots or generic "Buy the Dip"**

Wom wants TWO specific edge types:

### TYPE 1: Near-Certainties Not Priced In
- Markets where outcome is ~95%+ certain but priced at 70-85%
- Example: Kenneth Walker Super Bowl MVP spike (market lagged reality)
- Look for: locked-in nominations, obvious outcomes, info gaps

### TYPE 2: Hype Fade (Bet NO)
- Markets that spiked on news/hype but will revert
- Example: Greenland trade after Trump announcement
- Look for: 20%+ spikes, headline-driven, fundamentals don't support
