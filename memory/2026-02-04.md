### 7. **SONRIS Portal Deep Dive** 🔍

#### Black Books Search (Trenton Field)
- Accessed Black Books - Field Order Index: https://sonlite.dnr.state.la.us/pls/apex/f?p=BLACKBOOKS
- Solved reCAPTCHA (required multiple attempts)
- Searched **Trenton field** (Field ID: 8996) with **HA RA SU** units
- Found **39 Black Books records** matching criteria
- Drilled into Order **1199-E-10** → found 11 associated documents
- **PDF download blocked**: Windows native Save dialog can't be automated via browser

#### Haynesville SHALE Research - Key Discovery! 🎯
- **Critical insight**: Black Books indexes by FIELD NAME, not reservoir
- "Haynesville Shale" is a reservoir spanning multiple fields - NOT a field itself
- Searching "HAYNESVILLE SHALE", "HA SH", or "SHALE" in Black Books = no results
- **Solution**: Use LUW Search filtered by producing FIELD (not reservoir name)

#### Bethany Longstreet Field Success! ✅
- **Field ID**: 1464 (major Haynesville Shale producer in NW Louisiana)
- **LUW Search**: Type 2 UNIT + Field ID 1464
- **Results**: 2,401 units found!
- **Parishes**: De Soto, Caddo (core Haynesville Shale area)
- **Operators visible**: Comstock, Goodrich, SWN, Expand Operating
- **Unit Acreage**: Mostly 640 acres (standard shale unit size)

#### Creation Order Numbers Found
- **Visible in results**: 289-R-3, 289-R-9, 289-R-30 and many more
- These link directly to PDF documents via redirect URL
- **PDF URL pattern**: `https://sonlite.dnr.state.la.us/dnrservices/redirectUrl.jsp?dDocname=[CONTENT_ID]&showInline=True`

#### Technical Blocker 🚫
- **PDF download blocked**: Windows native Save dialog can't be automated via browser
- Would need manual intervention or different approach (e.g., curl with session cookies)

#### Next Steps for SONRIS
1. Click Creation Order links to access PDF documents
2. Find workaround for PDF download (manual or curl-based)
3. Upload PDFs to Google Drive folder: `My Drive > Sonris > Test`
