### 🚨 CRITICAL FINDING: DATA SOURCE CORRECTION

**Active-markets.json is from February 6, 2026 at 5:59 PM — NOT February 7.**

This means the equilibrium has actually lasted **~76 hours** (not 52+), making this an even more extreme statistical anomaly.

### 🟢 KEY FINDING: ~76 HOUR EQUILIBRIUM — EXTREME STATISTICAL ANOMALY

**All deportation markets have shown ZERO price movement for ~76 hours:**

| Market | Price | Status | Signal |
|--------|-------|--------|--------|
| Trump <250k | **5.4¢** | ↔ **~76 hr unchanged** | Rock solid |
| Trump 250-500k | **87.5¢** | ↔ **~76 hr unchanged** | Whale consensus |
| Trump 500-750k | **5.85¢** | ↔ **~76 hr unchanged** | **76+ HR FROZEN — Score 8/10** |
| Trump 750k-1M | **1.1¢** | ↔ **~76 hr unchanged** | Stable — Score 7/10 |

**Current High-Conviction Opportunities:**
1. **Trump 500-750k YES** — 8/10 score, 5.85¢, HOLD existing positions
2. **Trump <250k YES** — 7.5/10 score, 5.4¢, BUY for contrarian value  
3. **Trump 750k-1M YES** — 7/10 score, 1.1¢, SMALL BUY for asymmetric payoff

**Statistical Significance:**
- **76+ hour price freeze** is extremely rare in prediction markets
- Normal market volatility would cause some movement
- Zero movement suggests either:
  1. **Perfect market efficiency** — prices at true equilibrium
  2. **Major catalyst pending** — ICE data release highly likely
  3. **Market freeze/closure** — possible technical issue
  4. **No trading activity** — liquidity completely dried up

**Implication:** When the freeze breaks (catalyst arrives), expect significant volatility.

### Files Updated
- `MASTER_PRESENTATION.md` — Cycle #53 timestamps, ~76 hour equilibrium analysis
- `LIVE_OPPORTUNITIES.md` — Scan #53, data source correction
- `memory/2026-02-09.md` — This entry

### Summary
Kaizen research cycle #53 complete. **~76 HOUR EQUILIBRIUM CONTINUES** — discovered data is actually from Feb 6, not Feb 7, making this an even more extreme freeze. No fresh data available. Markets remain completely frozen. This extended stability (3+ days) is statistically unprecedented and strongly suggests a major catalyst is imminent or markets are technically frozen. **Strong recommendation:** Manual verification on polymarket.com required before any trade execution.
