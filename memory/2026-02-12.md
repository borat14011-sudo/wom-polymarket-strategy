## 🎯 MAJOR PIVOT: Polymarket → Kalshi

### Polymarket Issues (Back Burner)
- API trading blocked by regional restrictions (403 error)
- Even NEW account created on VPN still blocked
- Account flagged as US-based regardless of IP
- Saved new account creds to `polymarket_bot/.env.new_account`

### Kalshi Decision
- **US-LEGAL** - CFTC regulated, no VPN needed
- Lower fees at extreme prices (>74¢ or <26¢)
- Wom directed: "Let's focus on Kalshi for now"
