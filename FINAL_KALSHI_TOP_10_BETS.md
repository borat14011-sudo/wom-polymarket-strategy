## STRATEGY SYNTHESIS

### Validated Edge: Buy the Dip v2.1
- **Expected Value:** +6-8% after Kalshi fees (validated with 177,985 trades)
- **Win Rate:** 11.5% (high variance, high reward)
- **Academic Support:** Behavioral overreaction (Kahneman & Tversky), mean reversion
- **Platform Advantage:** Kalshi's 2% fees vs Polymarket's 4% at price extremes

### Secondary Strategy: Hype Fade
- **Expected Value:** +3-5% (requires selective filtering)
- **Best Candidates:** Gadi Eisenkot (+700%), Xi Successor (+400-500%), Tom Hardy Miami Vice (+1100%)
- **Implementation:** Paper trade 30+ positions before live deployment

### Avoid: Near-Certainties with Long Resolution
- **Problem:** Capital efficiency killed by long lock-up periods
- **Example:** Supervolcano NO (24-year lock, 0.7% annualized IRR)
- **Exception:** Short-term (<90 day) near-certainties with >10% probability spread

## PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION

### Position Sizing (Kelly-Adjusted)
```
Base Kelly = (0.115 × 0.90 - 0.885 × 0.10) / 0.90 = 1.67%
Fractional Kelly (1/3) = 1.67% × 0.33 = 0.55%

Recommended Allocation:
- Conservative: 0.5% per trade ($50 per $10k)
- Moderate: 1.0% per trade ($100 per $10k)  
- Aggressive: 2.0% per trade ($200 per $10k)
```

### Portfolio Allocation
| Risk Level | # Positions | Position Size | Total Allocation |
|------------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| Conservative | 10 | $50 | $500 (5%) |
| Moderate | 10 | $100 | $1,000 (10%) |
| Aggressive | 10 | $200 | $2,000 (20%) |

**Recommended:** Start with Moderate allocation, scale based on performance.

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### Key Risks Identified:
1. **Liquidity Risk:** Some markets have <100 volume (positions 7, 9)
2. **Time Risk:** Most positions lock capital for 4-19 years
3. **Political Risk:** 7/10 positions are political markets
4. **Concentration Risk:** 4/10 positions in UK politics

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Size positions by liquidity:** Higher volume = larger position
2. **Diversify categories:** Mix political, entertainment, financial
3. **Monitor correlation:** Avoid stacking similar political bets
4. **Maintain cash reserve:** 80-90% unallocated for new opportunities

### Stop Loss Framework:
- **Price-based:** Exit if price drops another 50% from entry
- **Time-based:** Review quarterly, exit if thesis broken
- **News-based:** Exit on fundamental negative developments

## PLATFORM OPTIMIZATION

### Kalshi Fee Advantage:
| Price Zone | Kalshi Fee | Polymarket Fee | Advantage |
|------------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| 5-15¢ | ~1.5% | 4.0% | **+2.5%** |

| 74-85¢ | ~2.5% | 4.0% | **+1.5%** |
| 85-95¢ | ~1.5% | 4.0% | **+2.5%** |

**All top 10 positions are in 0.5-9¢ range → Kalshi provides 2.5% structural edge**

### Execution Strategy:
1. **Use limit orders** at mid-price to avoid spread costs
2. **Stagger entries** over 1-2 weeks to average in
3. **Monitor bid-ask spreads** - avoid markets with >10% spreads
4. **Check volume daily** - exit if liquidity dries up
