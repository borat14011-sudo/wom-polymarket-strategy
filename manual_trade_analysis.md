- Total capital: $100
- Test capital: $10
- Position: $2.50 (0.5% of total, 25% of test)
- Shares: $2.50 / $0.12 = ~20.8 shares

**Expected Outcomes:**
- If correct (60% probability): Profit = 20.8 * $0.88 = $18.30
- If wrong (40% probability): Loss = $2.50
- Expected value: (0.60 * $18.30) - (0.40 * $2.50) = $10.98 - $1.00 = $9.98
