## DAY 1: SETUP (30 minutes)

### Morning (15 min):
1. ✅ **Pick ONE platform** to focus on:
   - Already have Instagram? Start there.
   - Like short videos? TikTok.
   - Want long-term SEO? YouTube Shorts.
   - **Pick ONE. Don't overthink it.**

   - Link: (We'll add this on Day 3)

### Afternoon (15 min):

   - "3 things I wish I knew before visiting [Madrid/Barcelona/Paris] with a baby"
   - "This [restaurant/hotel/attraction] saved our trip"
   - "Don't make this mistake in [city]"

## DAY 2: FILM (45 minutes)

### You Need:
- Your phone
- Natural light (near window or outside)
- **That's it. No fancy gear.**

### Filming Process:
1. **Open your camera app** (not Instagram yet - film in phone camera for better quality)

2. **Stand somewhere with good light**
   - Face the window, not away from it
   - Or go outside (golden hour = 1 hour before sunset)

3. **Film this simple structure** (record 3 takes, pick the best):
   - **0-3 seconds:** Hook (bold statement)
     - "This Madrid restaurant changed everything..."
   - **3-30 seconds:** The story/tip
     - Show the restaurant, explain what made it special
   - **30-45 seconds:** Payoff + CTA
     - "Follow for more family travel tips!"

4. **Record 2 backup videos while you're filming:**
   - Same location, different angle
   - You'll use these later

**Don't edit yet. Just film. Save raw footage.**

---

## DAY 3: EDIT & POST (60 minutes)

### Morning (30 min):
1. **Download CapCut** (free) on your phone

2. **Simple 3-step edit:**
   - Import video
   - Add text captions (auto-captions feature)

3. **Write caption** (use this template):
   ```

### Afternoon (30 min):
4. **POST IT**
   - Don't overthink
   - Post between 6-9 PM local time (when people scroll after work)
   - Turn on notifications

5. **Immediately engage:**

## 💡 COMMON MISTAKES (Avoid These!)

### ❌ Perfectionism:
"I need better camera/lighting/editing before I post"
**Reality:** Your phone is fine. Just start.

### ❌ Overthinking:
"Should I post at 7:23 PM or 7:47 PM for optimal engagement?"
**Reality:** Posting beats optimizing. Just pick evening and go.

### ❌ Too Many Platforms:
"I'll post on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest, and Twitter!"
**Reality:** You'll burn out in 3 days. Pick ONE for 90 days.

### ❌ Waiting for Motivation:
"I'll start when I feel inspired"
**Reality:** Inspiration comes from doing, not waiting.

### ❌ Comparing to Others:
"That account has 100K followers, I'll never catch up"
**Reality:** They started at 0 too. Focus on YOUR Day 1 vs Day 7.

## 🔥 THE MINDSET

**You're not building a business in 7 days.**

You're proving to yourself that you CAN:
- Film a video
- Post it publicly
- Set up monetization
- Send a pitch

**Everything else builds on these 4 skills.**

The person who films 1 imperfect video and posts it will always beat the person with 47 perfect ideas in their notes app.

## 🇰🇿 BORAT'S 7-DAY PEP TALK

**Day 1:** You feel excited. This is great time to film 10 videos while energy is high.

**Day 3:** You feel nervous before posting. This is normal. Post anyway.

**Day 4:** You check views 47 times. They are "only" 73 views. This is actually GOOD for Day 1.

**Day 5:** You want to quit because someone with 50K followers makes it look easy. They have 2 years and 500 videos behind them. You have ONE video. Keep going.

**Day 7:** You did it. You completed week 1. Most people never even start. You are now in top 10% just by DOING.

**This is GREAT SUCCESS!** 🎉
