## **SCENE 2: LAS MENINAS (0:05-0:13)**

**BORAT:**
"First painting: Las Meninas by Velázquez from year 1656. This is VERY famous painting. Many art experts say is masterpiece. Let us see what grandma thinks..."

**GRANDMA:**
"Why so many people in one room? This is like our apartment at Christmas time. Very crowded. I cannot even count how many persons! One... two... five... too many! I give 6 out of 10."

**BORAT:**
"Grandma, this is PRICELESS masterpiece worth millions of dollars!"

**GRANDMA:**
"Then they should not put SO MANY PEOPLE in one room! This is fire hazard!"

**[Pause for effect]**

## **SCENE 3: GOYA'S SATURN (0:13-0:21)**

**BORAT:**
"Next painting is by Francisco Goya. It is called 'Saturn Devouring His Son' from 1823. This one is... how you say... VERY DARK."

**GRANDMA:**
"WAWAWEEWA! What is THIS?! This man is eating... he is eating his CHILDREN?!"

**BORAT:**
"Yes, grandma. It is mythology story about—"

**GRANDMA:**
"This artist needs THERAPY! And maybe sandwich so he stop being so hungry! Why he eat his children?! In Kazakhstan we have problems but we do NOT eat children!"

**BORAT:**
"What is your rating, grandma?"

**GRANDMA:**
"2 out of 10. TOO DISTURBING. This give me nightmares. I will not sleep tonight."

## **SCENE 4: THE GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS (0:21-0:31)**

**BORAT:**
"Now we come to Hieronymus Bosch painting from year 1515. 'The Garden of Earthly Delights.' This one is... VERY confusing."

**[Long pause]**

**GRANDMA:**
"................"

**BORAT:**
"Grandma? Are you okay?"

**GRANDMA:**
"...what is HAPPENING here?"

**[Another pause]**

**GRANDMA:**
"Is this... is this dream after eating bad meat?"

**BORAT:**
"It is about sin and pleasure and—"

**GRANDMA:**
"I look at this painting for 5 minutes. Now I have MORE questions than before. There is bird-man, there is people in bubbles, there is giant strawberry... WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!"

**BORAT:**
"So what is rating?"

**GRANDMA:**
"9 out of 10."

**BORAT:**
"WHAT?! You give this 9?!"

**GRANDMA:**
"Yes. It is VERY confusing but also VERY interesting. I want to stare more. This artist was on SOMETHING."

## **SCENE 5: THE CLOTHED MAJA (0:31-0:39)**

**BORAT:**
"Next painting: 'The Clothed Maja' by Goya from 1800."

**GRANDMA:**
"Ah! Now THIS is nice painting!"

**BORAT:**
"Really? You like this one?"

**GRANDMA:**
"Yes! Beautiful lady. She is fully dressed. APPROPRIATE. Not like other painting where people are naked and doing strange things."

**BORAT:**
"So your rating?"

**GRANDMA:**
"8 out of 10. Would hang in my living room. Better than our family photos."

**BORAT:**
"Grandma, that is mean."

**GRANDMA:**
"Is TRUE."

## **SCENE 6: BABY INTERRUPTION (0:39-0:45)**

**[Baby crying sound effect - LOUD]**

**BORAT:**
"Oh no. The baby has woken up."

**[Crying continues, echoing in museum]**

**GRANDMA:**
"Baby rates entire museum: ZERO out of 10. She says is TOO QUIET."

**BORAT:**
"We are in ART MUSEUM, baby! You must be respectful!"

**[Baby cries louder]**

**GRANDMA:**
"She does not care about your Spanish culture."

---

## **SCENE 7: FINAL SCENE (0:45-0:55)**

**BORAT:**
"So, grandma, after seeing all these famous paintings at Prado Museum, what is your OVERALL rating?"

**GRANDMA:**
"Overall museum experience: 7 and a half out of 10."

**BORAT:**
"Why only 7 and a half?"

**GRANDMA:**
"My feet hurt. Art is nice but I am old woman, not Olympic athlete. Walking is difficult."

**BORAT:**
"What about the art itself?"

**GRANDMA:**
"Art is... acceptable. Some paintings are good. Some paintings make me question humanity. Baby is TERRIBLE art critic - she slept through everything and woke up only to scream."

**BORAT:**
"But you give 7.5. This is good rating!"

**GRANDMA:**
"Yes, because museum has ELEVATOR. Without elevator would be 3 out of 10. Elevator saves it."

**BORAT:**
"So you recommend Prado Museum?"

**GRANDMA:**
"Yes. But bring comfortable shoes. And maybe do NOT bring baby. And do NOT look too long at the man eating his children. This is my advice."

**BORAT:**
"GREAT SUCCESS! Thank you, grandma!"

**GRANDMA:**
"Now can we go eat churros?"

**BORAT:**
"Yes, grandma. We go eat churros."

**[Upbeat music swells]**

**BORAT:**
"Subscribe for more grandma reviews! She will judge MORE famous things! Maybe next time: Spanish food! Maybe Eiffel Tower! Maybe your life choices! Who knows! GREAT SUCCESS!"
