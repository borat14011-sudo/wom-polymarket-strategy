## **VIDEO DESCRIPTION:**

```
My 71-year-old grandma from Kazakhstan visited the Prado Museum in Madrid and had VERY strong opinions about famous paintings! 😂

Watch as she gives brutally honest reviews of:
🎨 Las Meninas by Velázquez: "Too crowded!" - 6/10
😱 Saturn Devouring His Son by Goya: "Needs therapy!" - 2/10
🤯 The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch: "What is happening?!" - 9/10
👗 The Clothed Maja by Goya: "Appropriate!" - 8/10

Plus... our 7-month-old baby interrupts EVERYTHING! 👶

Overall Museum Rating: 7.5/10 ("Museum has elevator - this saves it!")
