Either way, keep crushing it 🙌

#### Template 3: Brand/Business Partnership Pitch

```
Subject: Partnership opportunity - [Specific benefit for them]

Hi [Brand Name] Team,

I'd love to explore a partnership around [their product/service].

**Why I'm reaching out:**
- My audience is [specific demographic] - your ideal customer
- I've been using [product] for [time] and genuinely love it
- I have a track record of [specific result - e.g., "driving sales through authentic recommendations"]

**Partnership ideas:**
1. Sponsored content series ([X] posts/videos)
2. Affiliate partnership (I promote, earn commission)
3. Product seeding + organic posts
4. [Other creative idea specific to them]

**My reach:**
- [Platform]: [follower count], [avg engagement rate]
- [Platform]: [follower count], [avg engagement rate]
- Email list: [size]

**Past partnerships:** [Brand], [Brand], [Brand]

Would love to send over my media kit and discuss options. Are you the right person to chat with, or should I connect with someone else on your team?

Looking forward to hearing from you!

[Your name]
[Professional email]

### Sales Conversations

#### The Value Ladder Approach

**Stage 1: Free Content → Conversation**

```
[After they engage with free content]

Hey [Name]! Saw you [specific action - saved my post, watched my video, etc.].

Glad it was helpful! What's your biggest challenge with [topic] right now?
```

[They respond with their challenge]

**Stage 2: Identify Problem Depth**

```
Ah yeah, [challenge] is a big one. 

How long have you been dealing with this?

And what have you tried so far to fix it?
```

[They elaborate - you're gathering intel]

**Stage 3: Offer Help + Introduce Paid Solution**

```
Got it. So it sounds like [summarize their situation].

Here's the thing - you're probably going to keep struggling with this until you [specific missing piece].

I actually have [product/service] that walks you through exactly how to [solve their problem]. It's helped [X] people in your exact situation get [specific result].

Would that be helpful for you? Happy to send you the details if you're interested.
```

**If they say YES:**

```
Awesome! Here's what it includes:

[Bullet point benefits - outcome focused, not feature focused]

Investment: $[Price] [or payment plan if applicable]

Here's the link: [Link]

Any questions before you jump in?
```

**If they say "Maybe" / "I'll think about it":**

```
Totally fair! No pressure.

What's the main thing you're uncertain about? Happy to answer any questions.

[Or:]

No worries! In the meantime, check out [free resource] - it'll at least get you started in the right direction.

Door's open whenever you're ready 😊
```

**If they say "How much?":**

```
It's $[Price] [one-time / per month].

Considering [result they want], it pays for itself when you [specific outcome].

[Optional]: I also have a [payment plan / guarantee / bonus] if that helps.
```

**If they say "Too expensive":**

```
I totally understand! I've been there.

A couple thoughts:
1. When you compare it to [cost of NOT solving the problem], it's actually a steal
2. This is an investment in [desired outcome], not an expense
3. I offer [payment plan] if that makes it more manageable

But I also never want anyone to buy something they can't afford. If now isn't the right time, I have [lower-priced option or free content] that can help until you're ready.

What feels right for you?
```

**If they say "I need to talk to my [spouse/partner]":**

```
Absolutely! That's smart.

While you're discussing, here are a few things that might help:
- [Testimonial/result]
- [Specific ROI example]
- [Risk reversal - guarantee, refund policy]

Let me know what you guys decide! Happy to answer any questions that come up.
```

#### Objection Handling Scripts

**Objection: "I don't have time right now"**
```
I get it - we're all busy!

That's actually why I designed [product] to be [time-efficient feature]. Most people spend [short time period] per day and see results.

Plus, how much time are you spending right now trying to figure this out on your own? This could actually save you time in the long run.

What if you just started with [small commitment]?
```

**Objection: "I need to do more research"**
```
Smart! You should always do your due diligence.

What specifically do you want to research? Maybe I can point you to helpful info.

[Or if they're just stalling:]

I respect that! Just know that the longer you wait, the longer you're [negative consequence of inaction].

The good news: I have a [guarantee/trial/refund policy], so you can try it risk-free and if it's not right, no hard feelings.
```

**Objection: "I'll wait for a sale/discount"**
```
Fair question! I don't do sales often because I price things fairly from the start.

BUT - I do have [early bird pricing / bonus for fast action / payment plan] available right now.

Plus, think about it this way: if you wait 3 months for a $50 discount but lose 3 months of results, is it really worth it?

What feels right for you?
```

**Objection: "I'm not sure it'll work for me"**
```
That's a valid concern! I'd feel the same way.

Let me ask: what specifically makes you think it might not work for you?

[They answer]

Got it. Here's why it WILL work for you: [address their specific concern + proof]

Plus, I have a [guarantee], so you're not risking anything. If it doesn't work, you get your money back. Fair?
```

#### Closing Scripts

**The Assumptive Close**
```
Awesome! So here's the link to get started: [Link]

Once you're in, you'll get immediate access to [what they get]. I'll also send you a welcome email with next steps.

Excited to see your results! 🎉
```

**The Alternative Close**
```
Cool! So would you prefer [Option A] or [Option B]?

[Example: "the one-time payment or the 3-payment plan?"]
```

**The Urgency Close**
```
Love that you're ready!

Quick heads up: [bonuses / spots / price] are only available until [deadline], so if you want in, grab it here: [Link]

See you inside! 🚀
```

#### Post-Purchase Follow-Up
