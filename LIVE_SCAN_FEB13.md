| UK PM (Badenoch) | 6 | Political volatility, but 4-year timeframe |
| Polio Elimination | 3 | Steady public health progress track record |
| Next James Bond | 8 | Pure entertainment speculation |

## Recommendations

### EXECUTE (POLYMARKET):
1. **Los Angeles Kings to win 2026 Stanley Cup** - Medium position ($200-500)
   - Reason: Exceptional liquidity ($4.1M volume), good odds (3.4¢)
   - Expected Return: 2,782% if they win
   - Risk: 7/10 (Sports betting risk)
   - Hedge: Consider pairing with other top contenders

2. **Colorado Avalanche to win 2026 Stanley Cup** - Small position ($100-200)
   - Reason: High liquidity ($1.4M volume), reasonable price (23.4¢)
   - Expected Return: 318% if they win
   - Risk: 6/10 (Strong team, good value)

### EXECUTE (KALSHI):
1. **KXPOLIOELIM-30** - Small position ($50-100)
   - Reason: Social good component, steady progress track record
   - Limit: 1% of portfolio due to low volume

### PAPER TRADE:
1. **KXTAIWANLVL4-26JUL01** - Monitor for volume increase
2. **KXNEWPOPE-70-LANT** - Ultra-long term diversification play
3. **KXNEXTUKPM-30-KB** - Political volatility play

### AVOID:
1. All Kalshi markets with volume <$100
2. Complex sports parlays (illiquid, hard to analyze)
3. Polymarket markets with <$10K volume

## Strategy Adjustments Needed

Based on this scan, the Buy the Dip v2.1 strategy needs adjustment for Kalshi:

1. **Volume Threshold:** Reduce from $10K to $500 for Kalshi markets
2. **Time Filter:** Focus on <1 year resolutions rather than <7 days
3. **Data Source:** Need more current market data with accurate volume metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Refresh Data:** Obtain more current Kalshi market data
2. **Volume Verification:** Cross-check volume metrics with live Kalshi platform
3. **Focus Areas:** Look for newly listed markets with nearer-term resolutions
4. **Alternative Platforms:** Check Polymarket for more liquid, near-term opportunities
