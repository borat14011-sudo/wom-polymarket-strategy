# REAL $1 TRADE EXECUTION PLAN
## Polymarket Minimum Viable Trade

**Capital Available:** $1.00  
**Platform:** Polymarket  
**Reality:** This is a LEARNING trade, not an investment. Fees will exceed profit.

---

## THE MATH (Brutal Truth)

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Capital | $1.00 |
| Gas (deposit) | ~$0.50-1.00 |
| Gas (trade) | ~$0.25 |
| Gas (withdrawal) | ~$0.50-1.00 |
| **Total Gas** | **~$1.25-2.25** |
| **Net Available for Trading** | **-$0.25 to -$1.25** |

**Verdict:** $1 is below viable threshold. You'll lose money on fees alone.

---

## BEST ALTERNATIVE: LEAST-BAD OPTION

If you insist on trading, here's the least-painful path:

### Option A: Deposit to Polymarket, Buy 1 Share

**Market:** MSTR NO Dec 31 (lowest price = smallest position)

| Step | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Deposit $1 USDC | $0.50 gas | One-time |
| Buy 1 share NO @ 83.5¢ | $0.835 | Minimum possible |
| Gas for trade | $0.25 | Included in deposit gas usually |
| **Total Cost** | **~$1.59** | You're already underwater |
| Potential Win | $1.00 | If NO resolves yes |
| **Net Result if Win** | **-$0.59** | You lose even if right |

### Option B: Wait for Lower Gas

- Gas prices fluctuate (20-200 gwei)
- Trade when gas <20 gwei
- Even then, $1 is barely viable

### Option C: Use Different Platform

| Platform | Min Trade | Gas | Viable? |
|----------|-----------|-----|---------|
| Polymarket | ~$1 | $0.50+ | ❌ No |
| Kalshi | $1 | Lower | Maybe |
| Crypto.com | $1 | N/A | Check |

## MY RECOMMENDATION

**Don't do it.** 

With $1, you cannot overcome fixed gas costs. You will lose money even if your trade is correct.

**Better approach:**
1. Paper trade now with $1 (log it, track it)
2. Load another $9-19
3. Execute real trade at $10-20
4. $10 minimum achieves +8% net IRR

## IF YOU INSIST: THE $1 TRADE

**Market:** MSTR Dec 31 NO  
**Entry:** 83.5¢  
**Position:** 1 share ($0.835)  
**Expected Return:** $0.165 (if win)  
**Gas Cost:** ~$0.75-1.00  
**Net P&L:** -$0.60 to -$0.85

## WHAT TO DO NOW

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Check Polymarket Minimums:**
   - Visit: https://polymarket.com/event/microstrategy-500k-btc-dec-31
   - Check minimum order size (usually $1 equivalent)

2. **Check Gas Prices:**
   - Visit: https://etherscan.io/gastracker
   - If gas <25 gwei, proceed
   - If gas >50 gwei, wait

3. **Calculate True Cost:**
   - Deposit gas + trade gas + withdrawal gas
   - Must be <$0.30 to break even

4. **Alternative:**
   - Add $9 more to reach $10
   - Trade becomes economically viable

## FINAL VERDICT

**Trade Status:** NOT RECOMMENDED  
**Reason:** Fixed gas costs exceed expected profit  
**Alternative:** Paper trade or add capital  
**Minimum for viability:** $10  

**Your $1 is better spent on:**
- Gas to deposit $10
- Learning the interface
- Waiting for better opportunity
