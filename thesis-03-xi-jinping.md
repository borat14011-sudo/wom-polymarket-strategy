## THESIS

### The Setup
Xi Jinping, 71, has consolidated power as China's paramount leader. The market prices an 8.5% probability he leaves power before 2027 for any reason (death, coup, resignation, health issues).

### Base Rate Analysis

**Historical Precedent - Communist Party Leadership Changes:**

| Leader | Left Power | Age | Reason |
|--------|-----------|-----|--------|
| Mao Zedong | 1976 | 82 | Death |
| Deng Xiaoping | 1992 | 88 | Retirement |
| Jiang Zemin | 2002 | 76 | Retirement |
| Hu Jintao | 2012 | 70 | Retirement |
| Xi Jinping | Current | 71 | - |

**Observations:**
- No Chinese leader has been removed by coup in PRC history
- Natural death in office: 1/5 cases (Mao)
- Planned retirement: 3/5 cases
- Average age at departure: ~79

### Why 8.5% Might Be Underpriced

**1. Age and Health**
- Xi is 71 with reported health concerns
- Obesity, smoking history
- High-stress position

**2. Economic Crisis**
- Property sector collapse ongoing
- Youth unemployment elevated
- Deflationary pressures
- Economic stress → political instability

**3. Geopolitical Stress**
- Taiwan tensions escalating
- US-China decoupling
- Internal party dissent possible

**4. Base Rate for Authoritarian Leaders Age 70+**
- Annual mortality rate for 70-year-old male: ~2%
- Political risk adds another 1-2%
- 10-month horizon: ~3-4% baseline
- Market prices 8.5% = slight premium

### The Math

**Probability Assessment:**

| Outcome | Probability | Weight |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Natural death | 2% | 0.02 |
| Health retirement | 3% | 0.03 |
| Political coup | 2% | 0.02 |
| Resignation/scandal | 2% | 0.02 |
| **Total YES** | **~9%** | |
| Stays in power | 91% | 0.91 |

**Market price:** 8.5%  
**Estimated true probability:** 9%  
**Edge:** +0.5% (marginal)

**But...** If true probability is 12% (higher political risk):
- **Edge:** +3.5% over 10 months = +4.2% annualized
- Plus: Massive convexity if black swan event

### Execution Plan

**Entry:** 
- BUY YES at 8¢ or better
- Place limit orders at 7-8¢
- Be patient for dips

**Sizing:**
- Recommended: <1% of bankroll
- Rationale: Pure speculation / lottery ticket
- Alternative: Portfolio hedge against China exposure

**Exit:**
- If Xi publicly ill: Sell into strength (price will spike)
- If no news: Hold to expiration or cut at 5¢
- If coup attempt: Sell immediately (resolution uncertain)

### Information Asymmetry Problem

**Major Risk:** Chinese information control means:
- Health issues hidden until severe
- Coup attempts may not be public
- You may be trading blind vs insiders

**Mitigation:** 
- Small position size only
- Treat as insurance, not alpha
- Monitor: HK media, diplomatic rumors, military movements

### Catalyst Calendar

| Event | Date | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| NPC meetings | Mar 2026 | Health indicators |
| Party Plenum | Mid-2026 | Power consolidation |
| Economic data | Monthly | Stress indicators |
| Military exercises | Random | Taiwan tension |

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Xi survives easily | HIGH | Lose 100% |
| Info asymmetry | HIGH | Trading blind |
| Market manipulation | MEDIUM | Price swings |
| Resolution delay | MEDIUM | Capital tied up |

### Portfolio Context

**Use Cases:**
1. **Pure speculation:** <1% bankroll, lottery ticket mentality
2. **Hedge:** If you have China exposure, this is cheap insurance
3. **Tail risk:** Part of a "black swan" portfolio

**Correlation:**
- Negative correlation with Chinese equities (if Xi out → volatility)
- Positive correlation with geopolitical risk events
- Uncorrelated with most crypto/traditional assets

### Conclusion

This is a **lottery ticket**, not a high-conviction trade. The 8.5% price likely reflects fair value or slight overpricing given base rates. However, the massive convexity (1,060% return) and potential information asymmetry make it worth a tiny allocation for tail risk exposure.

**Action: TINY BUY YES at <8¢ with <1% position size. Expect to lose. Celebrate if you win.**
