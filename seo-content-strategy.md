---

### Thumbnail Design Strategy

**Winning Formula:**
- **Face close-up:** You + baby showing emotion (happy, surprised, tired)
- **Bold text:** 3-6 words max, readable on mobile
- **High contrast:** Bright background, dark text (or vice versa)
- **Consistent branding:** Same fonts, color scheme across videos

**Text Guidelines:**
- Font: Bold sans-serif (Impact, Montserrat Black, Bebas Neue)
- Size: Minimum 100pt font for readability
- Outline: White or black stroke around text for contrast
- Colors: Yellow, red, white = high CTR colors

**Examples:**
```
[Image: You looking shocked with baby] + Text: "14 HOURS?!"
[Image: Baby sleeping on plane] + Text: "HOW WE DID IT"
[Image: Pile of baby gear] + Text: "ONLY NEED 10"
[Image: Destination landmark with baby] + Text: "BABY LOVED IT"
```

**A/B Testing:**
- Test different emotions (happy vs. surprised)
- Test text vs. no text
- Test with/without baby in frame
- Use YouTube's thumbnail test feature

**Dimensions:** 1280x720px (16:9 ratio)  
**File size:** <2MB  
**Format:** JPG (smaller) or PNG (quality)

---

### YouTube Algorithm Optimization

**Watch Time is King:**
- First 30 seconds: Hook immediately, tease payoff
- Pattern interrupt every 30-60 seconds (cut, b-roll, text, sound effect)
- Ideal length: 8-15 minutes (balance engagement vs. watch time)
- Series/playlists boost session time

**Engagement Signals:**
- Ask question in first 30 seconds → answer in comments
- "Comment below which destination you want next!"
- Pin top comment with question or resource link
- Heart and reply to comments within first hour

**Upload Strategy:**
- Consistent schedule: Same day(s) each week
- Best times: Tue/Wed/Thu, 12-3pm or 6-8pm (test your audience)
- Premiere feature for subscriber engagement

**Playlists:**
- Organize by destination, topic, baby age
- Optimize playlist titles with keywords
- Set as "Series" playlist for sequential watching

---

## 5. Pinterest SEO Strategy

### Why Pinterest for Travel + Baby
- **Intent:** Pinners are PLANNERS (high-value audience)
- **Lifespan:** Pins live for months/years vs. Instagram (hours)
- **Traffic:** Can drive 30-50% of blog traffic
- **Buying mindset:** 85% use Pinterest to plan purchases

### Profile Setup

---

### Pin Design Strategy

**Optimal Dimensions:**

- **Long-form:** 1000x2100px (better performance but test both)

**Design Formula:**
```
[Top 1/3]: Eye-catching photo
[Middle 1/3]: Bold headline (keyword-rich)
[Bottom 1/3]: Subheading + branding/logo
```

**Text Overlay:**
- **Headline:** 30-50 characters, BIG and bold
- **Font:** Sans-serif, high contrast
- **Colors:** Bright, saturated (red, orange, teal perform well)
- **Branding:** Small logo/URL in corner

**High-Performing Pin Types:**
1. **List pins:** "15 Best Baby Carriers for Travel"

3. **Guides:** "Complete Guide to [Destination] with Baby"
4. **Before/After:** "Baby Travel Packing: What We Actually Used"
5. **Question pins:** "Can You Travel Internationally with a 2 Month Old?"
