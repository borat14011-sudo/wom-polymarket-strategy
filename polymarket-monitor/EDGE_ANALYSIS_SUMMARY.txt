        STRATEGY EDGE ANALYSIS - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

RESEARCH QUESTION:
  Does the "Trend Filter" strategy have real edge, or is the 95% win rate
  from data artifacts and overfitting?

ANSWER: REAL EDGE WITH CAVEATS
  
  ✅ Statistically significant (p < 0.0001)
  ✅ Robust across parameter variations
  ⚠️  BUT exploits proximity to market resolution
  ⚠️  AND likely not achievable at 95% in live trading

================================================================================
                            KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. THE SMOKING GUN 🔍

   What the strategy ACTUALLY does:
   
   ❌ NOT: "Follows price trends to predict future prices"
   ✅ YES: "Detects markets discovering their true outcome"
   
   Evidence:
   - Trend continuation rate: Only 41.8% (basically random!)
   - Win rate: 94.8% (far from random!)
   - Uptrends on YES markets: 88.9%
   - Uptrends on NO markets: 0.0%
   
   → Strategy identifies markets moving toward YES resolution, not "trends"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. DATA ARTIFACTS DETECTED ⚠️

   Exit Timing (CRITICAL):
   - Avg distance from final price: 0.006
   - Median distance: 0.000 (!!)
   - Exit: 5 data points before close
   
   → Strategy exits EXTREMELY close to resolution
   → In live trading, this precision is very hard to replicate
   
   Entry Timing:
   - 56% of entries in LATE stage (>50% of market life)
   - Only 25% in early stage
   
   → Strategy trades when outcomes are becoming clear

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. PARAMETER SENSITIVITY

   | Configuration       | Win Rate | Change   |
   |---------------------|----------|----------|
   | Original (3 rising) | 94.8%    | -        |
   | 2 rising points     | 98.1%    | +3.3%    |
   | 4 rising points     | 93.3%    | -1.5%    |
   | Exit 10 before      | 97.3%    | +2.5%    |
   | Exit 15 before      | 93.2%    | -1.6%    |
   | Exit 20 before      | 83.1%    | -11.7%   |
   
   VERDICT: Moderate sensitivity
   
   → Edge persists but degrades with conservative exits
   → Even at 20-point offset: 83% win rate (still strong!)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE

   Bootstrap Analysis (500 samples):
   
   - Actual win rate: 94.8%
   - 95% CI: [93.7%, 95.9%]
   - P-value vs random: 0.0000
   
   VERDICT: HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT
   
   → This is NOT luck
   → Edge is real in historical data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. MARKET-SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE

   Best Performance:
   - Volume: $10k - $100k
   - Activity: Medium (50-200 price points)
   - Entry timing: Late stage (but not too late)
   
   Avoid:
   - Micro markets (< $1k volume) - low liquidity
   - Mega markets (> $1M volume) - high competition
   - Very early entries (< 20% of lifetime)

================================================================================
                      COMPARISON: OTHER STRATEGIES
================================================================================

Trend Filter:
  Win Rate: 94.8% | Avg P&L: +0.35 | VERDICT: ✅ REAL EDGE

Time Horizon <3d:
  Win Rate: 33.8% | Avg P&L: -0.02 | VERDICT: ❌ NO EDGE (worse than random)

NO-Side Bias:
  Win Rate: 73.0% | Avg P&L: -0.003 | VERDICT: ❌ NO EDGE (wins small, loses big)

→ Trend Filter is the ONLY strategy with meaningful edge

================================================================================
                          REAL-WORLD VIABILITY
================================================================================

Backtest Says: 95% win rate, +0.35 avg profit

Reality Will Be:
  - Win rate: 75-85% (not 95%)
  - Avg profit: +0.15-0.25 (after fees, slippage)
  - Exit precision: Much harder in real-time
  - Liquidity: Thinner than historical data

Why the Gap?
  1. Exit timing (5 points before close) is optimistic
  2. No fees in backtest (reality: 2% on profits)
  3. No slippage in backtest (reality: 0.5-1% per trade)
  4. Perfect historical data (reality: delayed, noisy)
  5. No market impact (reality: your orders move prices)

================================================================================
                          RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. OUT-OF-SAMPLE TEST
   Run on 2024-2025 data if available, or paper trade new markets
   
2. CONSERVATIVE EXIT
   Use 15-20 point offset (not 5)
   Accept 83-93% win rate
   
3. FILTERS
   - Min volume: $10k
   - Min history: 50 points
   - Entry price: 0.10 - 0.75
   
4. REAL COSTS
   - Fees: 2% on profits
   - Slippage: 0.5% estimate
   - Position size: Max 1% of market volume

5. LIVE TESTING
   - Start: $100-500 total
   - Per trade: $10-20
   - Stop if win rate < 75% after 20 trades

================================================================================
                          CONFIDENCE LEVELS
================================================================================

HIGH (90%+):
  ✅ Strategy has edge in historical data
  ✅ Edge is statistically significant
  ✅ Identifies markets moving to YES outcomes

MEDIUM (60-80%):
  ⚠️  Edge persists in live trading (but smaller)
  ⚠️  75-85% win rate achievable
  ⚠️  Works across market types

LOW (30-50%):
  ❌ 95% win rate in live trading
  ❌ Exit timing precision in real-time
  ❌ Historical liquidity matches live

================================================================================
                          THE BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

Q: Does Trend Filter have real edge?
A: YES - but not for the reason you think

Q: Is it a "trend following" strategy?
A: NO - it's an "outcome discovery" strategy

Q: Can you trade it live?
A: YES - with realistic expectations

Q: Should you expect 95% win rate?
A: NO - expect 75-85%

Q: Is it worth testing?
A: YES - if you:
     • Start small ($100-500)
     • Accept lower performance than backtest
     • Monitor carefully and adapt
     • Can handle drawdowns

Q: Is it a "holy grail" strategy?
A: NO - it's a good edge that will compress over time

================================================================================
                          RISK DISCLOSURE
================================================================================

⚠️  Backtest performance ≠ Live performance
⚠️  Past performance ≠ Future results
⚠️  Edge may disappear as more traders discover it
⚠️  Polymarket rules may change
⚠️  Liquidity may be worse than historical
⚠️  You could lose money even with positive edge

TRADE SMALL. LEARN FAST. ADAPT OR EXIT.
