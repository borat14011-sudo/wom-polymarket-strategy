- **Key insight:** 55% of markets have >50% price swings = HIGH VOLATILITY confirmed

**5. Validation of MUSK_FADE_EXTREMES**
- 44 Musk markets showed <10% price movement (steady trend)
- Confirms extreme ranges immediately price to near-zero and stay there
- Strategy is ROBUST

### 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Next Tasks:**
1. Refine live scanner to filter by market end date (only <7 day markets for crypto fade)
2. Add price checking to validate edge criteria
3. Create deployment checklist for live trading
4. Build trade execution module (Web3 integration)

### 💡 INSIGHTS

- Polymarket API works but needs retry logic (occasional timeouts)
- Most current markets are sports/esports (pattern matches rare)
