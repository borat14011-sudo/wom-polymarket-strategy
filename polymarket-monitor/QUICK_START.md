### STEP 4: Make Your Decision 🚀

**Option A: GO LIVE** (My recommendation ✅)
1. Create Polymarket wallet
2. Fund with $100 USDC
3. Execute 3-5 manual trades this week
4. Review performance after 7 days

**Option B: MORE VALIDATION**
1. Paper trade 2 more weeks
2. Collect 20+ trades per strategy
3. Confirm win rates
4. Go live after validation

**Option C: BUILD AUTOMATION FIRST**
1. Create Web3 execution module
2. Add Telegram alerts
3. Semi-automated system
4. Then go live

**Option D: ALL IN PARALLEL** (KAIZEN STYLE 💪)
1. Go live with $100 manual
2. Build automation in background
3. Expand research
4. Scale up as we learn

### STEP 5: Tell Me What to Do Next

Just say:
- "Go live" → I'll guide you through wallet setup
