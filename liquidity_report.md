## Recommendations

1. **Focus on the 2 tradeable markets** - these offer genuine trading opportunities
2. **Avoid the 122 illiquid markets** - high slippage and poor price discovery
3. **Liquidity is the #1 filter** - 122 markets failed due to insufficient liquidity alone
4. **The "52% of markets have <$1 liquidity" problem is REAL** - many markets are essentially untradeable
