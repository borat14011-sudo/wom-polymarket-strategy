**✅ Only things you actually use** (maintains credibility)

**❌ Forgetting to track** (can't optimize)
**✅ Monthly review of stats** (double down on winners)

**❌ Giving up after month 1** (takes time!)
**✅ Consistent for 6 months** (compounds!)

Don't create content just for affiliate links.
Create amazing content, then add helpful links.

People buy from people they trust.
Build trust first, monetize second.
