## 🔥 SUPERVOLCANO ERUPTION (KXERUPTSUPER-0-50JAN01)
**Market: 13¢ bid / 19¢ ask | Last: 13¢**
**Expires: Before Jan 1, 2050 (~24 years)**

### Base Rate Calculation
- **VEI-8 (supervolcano) frequency**: ~1 per 50,000-100,000 years
- Using 100,000-year estimate: **0.001% per year**
- 24-year probability: 1 - (0.99999)^24 ≈ **0.024%**
- Using more aggressive 50,000-year estimate: **0.048%**

### Definition Risk
- Kalshi may use VEI-7 (which occurs every ~1,000 years)
- VEI-7 for 24 years: ~2.4%
- **CRITICAL**: Check contract definition for "supervolcano" threshold

### Market vs Reality
| Scenario | Base Rate | Market Price | Edge |
|----------|-----------|--------------|------|
| VEI-8 only | 0.024-0.048% | 13-19% | **~12-18¢ profit selling YES** |
| VEI-7+ | ~2.4% | 13-19% | ~10-16¢ profit selling YES |

### 🎯 RECOMMENDATION: **STRONG SELL YES @ 13¢**
- Expected value selling YES: ~$0.87 × 13¢ risk = +$0.115/contract
- Edge: **500-750x overpriced** vs actual base rate
- **CONFIDENCE: HIGH** (geological record is well-documented)

## 🌡️ 2°C WARMING BY 2050 (KXWARMING-50)
**Market: 78¢ bid / 81¢ ask | Last: 78¢**
**Expires: Before 2050 (~24 years)**

### Base Rate Calculation
- **Current warming**: ~1.2°C above pre-industrial
- **Remaining**: 0.8°C needed
- **Rate**: ~0.2°C per decade recently

### IPCC Projections (AR6, 2021-2023)
| Scenario | 2°C by 2050 Probability |
|----------|-------------------------|
| SSP1-1.9 (aggressive mitigation) | 20-30% |
| SSP2-4.5 (middle of road) | 40-50% |
| SSP3-7.0 (high emissions) | 60-70% |
| SSP5-8.5 (worst case) | 70-80% |

**Weighted consensus estimate**: ~50-65%

### Market vs Reality
| Estimate | Base Rate | Market Price | Edge |
|----------|-----------|--------------|------|
| IPCC consensus | 50-65% | 78-81% | ~13-28¢ overpriced |
| Conservative | 55% | 78% | ~23¢ selling YES |

### 🎯 RECOMMENDATION: **MODERATE SELL YES @ 78¢**
- Edge: 13-28% overpriced
- **RISK**: Climate could accelerate; models have underestimated
- **CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM** (high uncertainty in climate systems)
- Consider smaller position or NO @ 19-22¢ instead

## 🚀 MARS COLONIZATION BY 2050 (KXCOLONIZEMARS-50)
**Market: 16¢ bid / 20¢ ask | Last: 16¢**
**Expires: Before 2050 (~24 years)**

### Base Rate Calculation
Key requirements for "colonization":
1. Successful Mars landing (SpaceX targeting 2029-2030)
2. Sustained presence (not just flags-and-footprints)
3. Multiple missions, infrastructure

### Expert Estimates
| Source/Factor | Probability |
|---------------|-------------|
| SpaceX Starship timeline (optimistic) | 10-20% |
| Historical space program delays | -50% multiplier |
| Technical challenges (radiation, ISRU, life support) | -30% multiplier |
| Definition of "colonize" (how many people?) | Variable |

**Adjusted estimate**: 5-12%

### Market vs Reality
| Scenario | Base Rate | Market Price | Edge |
|----------|-----------|--------------|------|
| Optimistic (SpaceX succeeds) | 12% | 16-20% | 4-8¢ overpriced |
| Realistic (historical delays) | 5-8% | 16-20% | 8-15¢ overpriced |

### 🎯 RECOMMENDATION: **WEAK SELL YES @ 16¢**
- Edge: ~5-10¢
- **RISK**: SpaceX has surprised before; Elon factor
- **CONFIDENCE: LOW-MEDIUM** (tech disruption possible)
- Small position only

## 🧑‍🚀 ELON MUSK ON MARS BY 2099 (KXELONMARS-99)
**Market: 7¢ bid / 8¢ ask | Last: 8¢**
**Expires: Aug 1, 2099 (~73 years)**

### Base Rate Calculation
- Elon Musk born 1971 → Age 54 now (2026)
- Would be 128 in 2099
- **Actuarial survival to 2099**: <1% (without radical life extension)

### Probability Tree
| Factor | Probability |
|--------|-------------|
| SpaceX develops Mars capability | 30-50% |
| Mars missions succeed before Elon dies | 15-25% |
| Elon personally goes (health, desire) | 20-40% |
| Combined (assuming correlation) | **3-8%** |

### Life Extension Wild Card
- If radical life extension tech emerges: +2-5% adjustment
- Cryonics scenario: negligible

**Adjusted estimate**: 3-6%

### Market vs Reality
| Scenario | Base Rate | Market Price | Edge |
|----------|-----------|--------------|------|
| No life extension | 3-5% | 7-8% | 2-5¢ overpriced |
| With life extension | 5-8% | 7-8% | ~0-3¢ (fair) |

### 🎯 RECOMMENDATION: **MARGINAL SELL YES @ 7¢**
- Edge: ~0-3¢
- Bid-ask spread (7-8¢) eats most of edge
- **CONFIDENCE: LOW** (73-year horizon, many unknowns)
- **PASS** - not enough edge for capital lock-up

## ⚠️ RISK FACTORS

### Supervolcano Trade Risks
1. **Definition ambiguity**: Does VEI-7 count?
2. **Black swan**: Unknown volcanic activity
3. **Contract settlement**: How is eruption verified?

### Climate Trade Risks
1. **Measurement disputes**: Which dataset?
2. **Climate acceleration**: Models consistently conservative
3. **Political definition changes**: Pre-industrial baseline

### General Kalshi Risks
1. **Counterparty risk**: Platform solvency over 20+ years
2. **Capital lockup**: Opportunity cost on long-dated contracts
3. **Rule changes**: Contract amendments possible

## 💡 EXECUTION STRATEGY

### Position Sizing
- Supervolcano: **5-10% of trading capital** (highest conviction)
- Nick Fuentes: **3-5%** (high conviction, meme risk)
- 2°C Warming: **2-3%** (medium conviction, high uncertainty)
- Mars: **1-2%** (low conviction)

### Timing
- Enter on spikes (supervolcano spiked to 20¢ recently)
- Bid patiently below ask when possible
- Long-dated = no rush
