## 🆕 NEW STRATEGY HYPOTHESES (From Pattern Analysis Subagent)

### 1. **BRACKET_SKEW — Mispriced Tails in Range Markets** ⭐ DEPLOY FIRST

**Thesis:** In bracketed markets (GDP 0-1%, 1-2%, 2-3%, etc.), middle brackets are efficiently priced but TAILS are mispriced:
- **Extreme negative outcomes = OVERPRICED** (fear premium)
- **Extreme positive outcomes = UNDERPRICED** (lack of imagination)

**Logic:** Prospect theory — people overweight catastrophic outcomes. Same as options skew in equities but no market makers to correct it.

**Current Application (From Today's Scan):**
| Market | Bracket | Current Price | Mispricing Signal |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Tariff Revenue | $500B-$1T | 0.1% | Underpriced positive tail? |
| Tariff Revenue | $1T-$2T | 0.1% | Underpriced extreme? |
| Deportation | <250k | 5.8% | Fear premium in negative? |
| Deportation | 250-500k | 89.5% | Middle bracket efficient |

**Validation:** Snapshot all bracket markets, sum probabilities, identify >103% total = mispriced tails.
**Est. Edge:** 5-12% systematic. **Dozens of qualifying markets.**

---

### 2. **WEEKEND_STALE — Liquidity Vacuum Mispricing** ⭐ START THIS WEEKEND

**Thesis:** Markets become stale Friday night → Sunday. News that breaks over weekend isn't priced until Monday.

**Logic:** Retail traders dominate Kalshi. Volume drops 60-80% on weekends. Friday executive orders or Saturday data releases create 36-48 hour pricing delay.

**This Weekend Application:**
- **Valentine's Day (today)** — Reduced attention, emotional retail trading
- **Presidents Day Monday** — Markets thin, potential Trump announcements

**Action Plan:**
1. Monitor news RSS feeds Saturday/Sunday
2. Check Kalshi prices Sunday 11 PM
3. Place orders Monday pre-8 AM on stale prices

**Est. Edge:** 3-7% per event, 70%+ win rate on known information vs stale prices.

---

### 3. **DEADLINE_DRIFT — Late Resolution Convergence Lag**

**Thesis:** Long-horizon markets (3-12 months) stay anchored to initial prices too long. Final 10-20% of market lifespan captures most price movement.

**Logic:** Anchoring bias + liquidity thinning. Answer becomes 90% knowable 30 days before resolution but price only reflects 60-70%.

**Current Candidates:**
- **Deportation markets** — Resolution Dec 2025, ~10 months away
- **Tariff revenue** — Resolution Feb 27, ~2 weeks away ← **APPROACHING DEADLINE**

**Est. Edge:** 8-15% in final 30 days. High IRR due to short holding period.

---

### 4. **CORRELATED_CLUSTER_ARB — Cross-Market Inconsistency**

**Thesis:** Related markets priced by different trader pools. When Market A moves on news but correlated Market B doesn't, there's free edge.

**Current Pairs to Monitor:**
- Tariff revenue brackets vs. Trade deficit markets
- BTC price vs. BTC volatility markets
- Deportation count vs. Immigration policy markets

**Est. Edge:** 5-10% per trade, 3-5 opportunities per month.

---

### 5. **NARRATIVE_EXHAUSTION — Fading Sustained Media Cycles**

**Thesis:** When a topic dominates news for 7+ consecutive days, markets overshoot. Fade the narrative.

**Different from Hype Fade:** Targets SUSTAINED multi-day cycles, not single spikes.

**Current Narrative Watch:**
- AI regulation coverage
- Tariff coverage (ongoing)
- Deportation coverage (ongoing)

**Est. Edge:** 10-20% but only 1-2 per month. High variance.
