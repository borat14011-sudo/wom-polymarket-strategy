## 🍴 FOOD REELS (3)

### REEL 11: "Borat Orders Tapas Wrong (And You Should Too!)"
**Hook:** "In Madrid, I order food like IDIOT... and locals LOVE me! Here's why:"

**Visual Flow:**
1. Borat at tapas bar, confused by menu
2. Points at random dishes, says "I take this, and THIS, and THREE of those!"
3. Locals laugh, bartender brings MOUNTAIN of food
4. Grandma: "We did not order this much..."
5. Borat: "In Kazakhstan, we share! Is called TAPAS!" (locals applaud)

**Script:**
> "Listen, tourists always ask: 'What tapas should I order?' Wrong question!
> 
> In Madrid, you walk into bar, you point at things, you say 'UNO MÁS' many times.
> 
> Here's SECRET: Every bar has specialty. You see locals eating something? You point and say 'LO MISMO' (the same).
> 
> They ordered JAMÓN? You order jamón. They drinking VERMOUTH? You drink vermouth.
> 
> Spanish people LOVE when you copy them. Is biggest compliment!
> 
> Also: Never order MORE than 2-3 tapas per person. Unless you Borat, then order 10 and make friends with leftovers.

> WAWAWEEWA!"

1. Clock shows 2:45 AM
2. Borat leaving nightclub, still dancing
3. Grandma (surprisingly awake): "Where we going now?"
4. Borat: "To breakfast!" (she's confused)
5. Chocolatería San Ginés - line out the door at 3 AM
6. Dunking churros in chocolate, everyone happy

**Script:**
> "You think churros are breakfast food? WRONG!
> 
> In Madrid, churros are what you eat AFTER the clubs, BEFORE you sleep.
> 
> Here's the routine: Dinner at 10 PM → Drinks at midnight → Club at 2 AM → Churros at 4 AM → Sleep at 6 AM.
> 
> Chocolatería San Ginés - open since 1894, open 24 HOURS. This place has seen things...
> 
> Pro tip: Order 'churros con chocolate' - 6 churros, thick hot chocolate for dipping. Share with grandmother. She will judge you less for staying out so late.
> 
> Cost: €4.50. Memories: PRICELESS.
> 
> Also works at 3 PM if you have baby and cannot stay awake past 9 PM. No shame, is called 'merienda.'
> 
> GREAT SUCCESS!"

### REEL 13: "Baby-Friendly Restaurants Madrid (That Don't Suck)"
**Hook:** "Traveling with 7-month-old in Madrid? These restaurants will SAVE YOUR LIFE!"

**Visual Flow:**
1. Borat pushing stroller, baby crying
2. Tries fancy restaurant - waiter gives dirty look
3. Borat: "Okay, we go to SECRET places..."
4. Montage of 3 baby-friendly spots
5. Baby happy, eating puree, parents relaxed
6. Borat: "GREAT SUCCESS!"

**Script:**
> "Listen, not all Madrid restaurants want your screaming baby. Is okay, I understand.
> 
> But THESE places? They LOVE babies:
> 
> **1) Mercado de San Miguel** - market with high chairs, can walk around when baby cries, tapas for everyone. Baby eats jamón, becomes Spanish citizen.
> 
> **2) La Mucca de Prado** - Italian place, they EXPECT children. Waiters play with baby while you eat. Pasta is cheap. Wine is necessary.
> 
> **3) Any 'Cervecería' with outdoor patio** - Spanish people bring ENTIRE extended family to lunch. Your one crying baby? Nobody even notice. Is white noise.
> 
> Pro tip: Go at 2 PM for lunch. Is when locals eat. If baby screams, 47 other children already screaming. Your baby fits RIGHT IN.
> 
> Also: Bring puree pouches. Spanish baby food is good, but your baby might go on STRIKE for new flavors. Trust Borat on this.
> 
> WAWAWEEWA!"

> 
> Prado Museum - world-class art, THIRD-CLASS changing tables.
> 
> Here's survival guide:
> 
> **Before you enter ANY museum:**
> - Google 'cambiador bebe' (changing table) + museum name
> - Prado HAS them, but only on Floor 0 (basement)
> - Reina Sofía - Floor 1, near Picasso
> - If NO changing table? Bathroom floor. Bring changing pad. Is not ideal, but is LIFE.
> 
> **Emergency kit for Madrid museums:**
> - 5 diapers (not 2, not 3, FIVE)
> - Wipes (Spanish wipes are small, bring double)
> - Plastic bags (for biological weapons disposal)
> - Change of clothes for baby AND YOU (trust me)
> - Small blanket (European changing tables are COLD metal)
> 
> **Pro tip:** Change diaper BEFORE entering museum, even if clean. This is called 'preemptive strike.'
> 
> Bonus: Retiro Park has NO changing stations. Use grass. Is natural. Velázquez would approve.
>

> 
> **SMOOTH PATHS (Angels singing):**
> - **Retiro Park:** Paved paths, wide, ZERO cobblestones. Can run marathon with stroller.
> - **Paseo del Prado:** Museum mile, smooth sidewalks, wheelchair accessible = stroller paradise
> - **Gran Vía:** Main shopping street, modern sidewalks, gentle slopes
> - **Salamanca neighborhood:** Rich people sidewalks = VERY SMOOTH
> 
> **AVOID OR YOU DIE:**
> - **La Latina (old town):** Cobblestones from medieval times, stroller wheels scream for mercy
> - **Plaza Mayor area:** Bumpy, crowded, your baby will hate you
> - **Any street called 'Calle de...':** Old = charming = NIGHTMARE for wheels
