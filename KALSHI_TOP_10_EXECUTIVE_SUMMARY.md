- **Expected Value:** +6-8% after Kalshi fees
- **Win Rate:** 11.5% (high variance)
- **Sample Size:** 177,985 historical trades
- **Academic Support:** Behavioral overreaction + mean reversion

- Focus on **positions 1-6** first (highest conviction)
- Use **limit orders** at mid-price
- **Monitor weekly**, adjust based on results

**EXPECTED TIMELINE:**
- **Week 1:** Execute positions, set up monitoring
- **Month 1:** First review, adjust if needed  
- **Quarter 1:** Statistical validation (should see ~1 win)
- **Year 1:** Portfolio performance assessment

**SUCCESS = PATIENCE + DISCIPLINE:**
These are long-duration positions with high expected value but require holding through volatility. The validated +6-8% edge compounds significantly when applied to extreme price dislocations (35-43% EV).
