| Comeback Wins | 25% (1/4) | n=4 |

## 2. MVP MARKET TRENDS

### Historical MVP Winners:
- **SB LVII (2023):** Patrick Mahomes (QB) - 70%+ implied probability
- **SB LVIII (2024):** Patrick Mahomes (QB) - 35% implied, heavy underdog
- **SB LIX (2025):** Jalen Hurts (QB) - 40% implied

### MVP Trends:
| Metric | Value |

- None have won in the last 3 Super Bowls
- High variance but low hit rate

| Result | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Heads | 2 | 50% |
| Tails | 2 | 50% |

**Pattern:** Perfect 50/50 distribution. No edge in coin toss historically.

### Gatorade Shower Color (n=3 recorded)
| Color | Count | Percentage |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Purple | 1 | 33% |
| Blue | 1 | 33% |

### National Anthem Duration
- Average: ~105-115 seconds
- Variance: ±15 seconds
- Market typically sets O/U at 119.5 seconds

### First Touchdown Scorer
- Historically favors RBs and TEs over WRs
- Travis Kelce has been popular choice in Chiefs games

## 4. PRICE MOVEMENT PATTERNS

### Line Movement Analysis
**Opening vs. Closing Prices:**
1. **Super Bowl LVIII (Chiefs-49ers):**
   - Open: 49ers -2.5
   - Close: Pick'em / 49ers slight favorite
   - Movement toward underdog (Chiefs)

2. **Super Bowl LIX (Eagles-Chiefs):**
   - Open: Chiefs -2.5
   - Close: Chiefs -4.5
   - Movement toward favorite
   - Result: Favorite lost

**Pattern:** Lines don't consistently drift in one direction. Public money often overvalues favorites.

|-------------|---------------------|
| Moneyline | 75% (3/4) |
| MVP | 66% (2/3) |
| Coin Toss | 50% (random) |

**Key Finding:** High volume does NOT guarantee accuracy. In SB LIX, Chiefs had massive volume but lost.
