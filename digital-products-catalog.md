- Same infrastructure advantages
- Easy to embed sample photos in product page
- Creator audience aligns with Gumroad's community

**Secondary: Etsy**
- Search: "photography guide," "Instagram travel guide"
- Printable PDF category
- Wedding/travel photographers browse here

**Alternative Platforms:**
- **Creative Market** - Designer/photographer audience perfect fit
- **Payhip** - Good alternative to Gumroad
- **Not great:** Amazon (formatting limitations for photo-heavy PDFs)

**Marketing Channels:**
- **Instagram:** Post sample photos from locations → link in bio
- **Pinterest:** Each location as separate pin → drives massive traffic
- **YouTube:** "Madrid Photography Spots" video → PDF in description
- **Photography forums:** Reddit (r/photography, r/travel), photography Facebook groups

**Affiliate Strategy:**
- Partner with Madrid travel bloggers (20% commission)
- Photography influencers (they love location guides)
