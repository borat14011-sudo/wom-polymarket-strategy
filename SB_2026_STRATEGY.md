## 1. Pre-Game Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Matchup (AFC vs NFC Champions)

**Current Futures Markets** (as of Feb 2026 snapshot):
| Conference | Favorite | Challenger |
|------------|----------|------------|
| AFC | Chiefs ($924K volume) | Bills, Ravens, Bengals |
| NFC | 49ers ($737K volume) | Eagles, Lions, Packers |

### Step 2: Determine Market Sentiment

**Check for Public Bias Indicators**:
- [ ] Is one team a "dynasty" (Chiefs)? → Public will overbet them
- [ ] Is one QB more popular (Mahomes)? → MVP market inflated
- [ ] Are there narrative storylines? → Creates prop value

### Step 3: Identify Value Opportunities

**Favorites to Fade**:
- Chiefs moneyline if priced >55%
- Mahomes MVP if priced >40%
- Any "sexy" narrative prop (Swift-related, etc.)

**Underdogs to Consider**:
- Any NFC team priced <45% vs Chiefs
- Any AFC team priced <40% vs NFC favorite
- MVP longshots at 15-25%

## 2. Core Betting Strategy for SB 2026

### Strategy A: The Underdog Moneyline (Primary Position)

**Historical Edge**: 100% win rate (2/2)
**Expected ROI**: +150% to +200%
**Recommended Allocation**: 30-40% of Super Bowl bankroll

**Execution**:
1. Wait until 1 week before game for lines to stabilize
2. Identify which team is the underdog (<50% implied probability)
3. Bet 5-10% of bankroll on underdog moneyline
4. **Do NOT hedge** - let it ride based on historical pattern

**Risk Assessment**: 
- Low risk: Historical trend is strong
- Counter-argument: "Law of averages" doesn't exist; each game independent
- Mitigation: Only bet if underdog is priced 40-48% (not extreme underdog)

---

### Strategy B: Fade the MVP Favorite (Secondary Position)

**Historical Edge**: 50% upset rate with massive +EV when correct
**Expected ROI**: +300% to +500%
**Recommended Allocation**: 20-25% of Super Bowl bankroll

**Execution**:
1. Identify MVP favorite (likely QB of favorite team)
2. If favorite is priced >50%, FADE completely
3. Target QB or WR on winning team at 20-35% implied probability
4. Consider defensive player or TE at 5-15% for small position

**2026 Specific Notes**:
- If Chiefs make it: Mahomes will be 50%+ MVP favorite → FADE
- If Bills make it: Allen will be 40%+ → Borderline fade
- If Eagles make it: Hurts won't be heavy favorite → Possible play

**Example Portfolio** (if Chiefs vs Eagles):
- Saquon Barkley MVP: $0 (heavily bet, overpriced)
- Jalen Hurts MVP: $100 (30% implied)
- AJ Brown MVP: $50 (15% implied)  
- Travis Kelce MVP: $25 (5% implied - narrative value)

---

### Strategy C: Prop Bet Portfolio (Diversification)

**Recommended Allocation**: 35-45% of bankroll across 8-12 prop markets

#### Tier 1 Props (High Confidence)
| Prop | Strategy | Allocation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Gatorade Color | Wait for winner clarity, then bet their color | 5% |
| Coin Toss | Skip or tiny position (50/50) | 0-1% |
| National Anthem | Bet 100-130s range | 3% |

#### Tier 2 Props (Medium Confidence)
| Prop | Strategy | Allocation |
|------|----------|------------|
| First TD Scorer | Fade RB favorites, look at QBs/WRs | 2% each |
| Anytime TD Scorer | Star players on both teams | 2% each |
| Total Points O/U | Historical average ~50 | 3% |

#### Tier 3 Props (Contrarian/Longshot)
| Prop | Strategy | Allocation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Safety | Rare but +600 odds | 1% |
| Overtime | ~10% historical rate | 1% |
| Defensive TD | High variance | 1% |

---

### Strategy D: Live/In-Game Betting

**Recommended Allocation**: 10-15% reserved for live opportunities

**Live Value Spots**:
1. **End of Q1**: If favorite trails, bet on them to win Q2
2. **Halftime**: Adjust MVP bets based on first-half performance
3. **End of Q3**: If game close, bet underdog to win Q4
4. **2-minute warning**: Look for value on comeback bets

---

## 3. Specific Recommendations by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Chiefs (Favorite) vs NFC Team

**Primary Strategy**: BET NFC UNDERDOG
**Historical Precedent**: Eagles (2025), Chiefs were underdog (2024)
**Rationale**: Public overbets Chiefs, creating value on opponent

**MVP Strategy**: 
- Fade Mahomes if >45%
- Target NFC QB at 25-35%
- Target NFC WR at 10-20%

**Prop Strategy**:
- Gatorade: Wait, then bet NFC team color
- First TD: Consider NFC QB rushing
- Trump props: If Chiefs in SB, Trump mentions likely overvalued

---

### Scenario 2: Bills (Favorite) vs NFC Team

**Primary Strategy**: BET NFC UNDERDOG or PASS
**Rationale**: Less public bias than Chiefs, but still present

**MVP Strategy**:
- Josh Allen likely 40%+ favorite → Borderline fade
- Target NFC QB at 30%

---

### Scenario 3: AFC Underdog vs NFC Favorite

**Primary Strategy**: BET AFC UNDERDOG
**Example**: Bengals vs 49ers

**Rationale**: 
- NFC favorites (49ers, Eagles) get public support
