## 🚨 CRITICAL NEW DISCOVERY: THRESHOLD MARKET OVERPRICING

### MASSIVE EDGE: "When Will X Happen" Markets Are Systematically Overpriced

These markets have NESTED outcomes (Before 2027 implies Before 2028, 2029, etc.). The market totals sum to >100% because they're selling MULTIPLE correlated outcomes. This creates **calendar arbitrage** opportunities.

**Markets with >100% Total Bids:**

| Market | Total Bids | Total Asks | Exploitable? |
|--------|------------|------------|--------------|
| Musk Trillionaire Timeline | 341% | 449% | YES - Buy latest bracket |
| Travis Kelce Groomsmen | 404% | 447% | CAUTION - Multiple can be true |
| Taylor Swift Bridesmaids | 552% | 782% | CAUTION - Multiple can be true |
| IShowSpeed YouTube 100M | 185% | 218% | YES - Buy latest bracket |
| Last of Us Season 3 | 166% | 200% | YES - Buy latest bracket |
| Nuclear Fusion | 142% | 150% | YES - Buy latest bracket |
| EV Market Share 2030 | 220% | 242% | NO - Nested (>10% implies >20% is FALSE) |
| Unemployment Before 2030 | 442% | 500% | NO - Nested |

**Strategy for Timeline Markets:**
- Buy the LATEST bracket only (Before 2030, Before 2040)
- Let earlier brackets expire worthless
- Capture the implied probability discount

## 🎯 ACTIONABLE TRADES — PRIORITY RANKED

| Rank | Market | Trade | Entry | Target | Edge | Size |
|------|--------|-------|-------|--------|------|------|
| 1 | Supervolcano 2050 | BUY NO | 81-87¢ | 100¢ | ~15% | $5 max |

| 5 | Pope Tagle (dip) | BUY YES | 5-8¢ | 10¢+ | Mean reversion | $1 |

## 🧪 HYPOTHESES FOR FUTURE TESTING

### H1: "Doomsday Bias Persistence"
Retail traders consistently overprice catastrophic events. Track resolution rates of disaster markets vs. implied probability.

### H2: "Oversold Reversion"
Markets flagged as `is_dip_candidate` (>20% daily drop) revert within 7 days 60%+ of the time.

### H3: "Bracket Arbitrage"
Buying only the longest-dated bracket in "When will X happen" series captures free optionality from earlier brackets.

### H4: "Volume/Spread Inefficiency"
Markets with >100k volume but >30% bid-ask spread can be profitably market-made.
