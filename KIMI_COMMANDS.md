# 🎯 Kimi Trading & Content Commands

## Quick Model Switching

When chatting with me, I'll use the default model (Kimi 0905). To get different model behavior:

### For Trading Tasks

**Quick market check (7B - fastest, cheapest)**
```
Quick check: What's the sentiment on [market]?
```

**Strategy development (K2.5 - best reasoning)**
```
Strategic analysis: Help me design a strategy for [market]...
```

**Deep analysis (Thinking - shows reasoning)**
```
Deep analysis: What factors could affect [market] outcome?
```

**Standard operations (0905 - default)**
```
Execute: Place a trade analysis on [market]...
```

### For Content Tasks

**Long-form content (K2.5)**
```
Write a comprehensive article about...
```

**Quick summaries (7B)**
```
Summarize this in 3 bullet points...
```

**Research synthesis (Thinking)**
```
Analyze this research and explain your reasoning...
```

**Standard writing (0905)**
```
Write a blog post about...
```

## Cost-Effective Workflow

### Trading Workflow
1. **Scan** → Use 7B for quick market overview
2. **Analyze** → Use Thinking for deep dive on promising markets
3. **Strategize** → Use K2.5 for position sizing and risk
4. **Execute** → Use 0905 for order logic and monitoring
5. **Report** → Use 7B for daily P&L summaries

### Content Workflow
1. **Ideate** → Use 7B for brainstorming topics
2. **Research** → Use Thinking for gathering insights
3. **Outline** → Use K2.5 for structure and flow
4. **Draft** → Use 0905 for content generation
5. **Polish** → Use 0905 or K2.5 for editing

## Model Aliases (for quick reference)

| What you say | Model Used |
|--------------|------------|
| "Quick..." / "Brief..." | 7B (fastest) |
| "Strategic..." / "Design..." | K2.5 (most capable) |
| "Analyze..." / "Explain your thinking..." | Thinking (shows reasoning) |
| (default) | 0905 (balanced) |

## Cost Estimates

### Trading (Active Daily Use)
- 10 quick checks/day (7B): ~$0.10/day
- 5 standard analyses/day (0905): ~$0.50/day
- 2 strategic sessions/week (K2.5): ~$0.50/week
- 3 deep analyses/week (Thinking): ~$0.45/week
- **Monthly total: ~$25-35**

### Content (Moderate Use)
- 20 quick tasks/week (7B): ~$0.50/week
- 10 articles/week (0905): ~$5/week
- 2 long-form/week (K2.5): ~$2/week
- 5 research tasks/week (Thinking): ~$1/week
- **Monthly total: ~$35-45**
