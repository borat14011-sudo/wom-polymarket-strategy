## 🇰🇿 BORAT'S CONTENT CALENDAR WISDOM

**"In Kazakhstan, we plan harvest 6 months ahead. You should plan content same way."**

**Why 90 days?**
- Long enough to see patterns
- Short enough to stay flexible
- Builds consistency habit

**The Secret:** Batch production + daily engagement

**You film 1 day. Edit 1 day. You have 2 weeks of content. Then you engage daily. This is sustainable way.**

**Not:** Create content every day (burnout)  
**Instead:** Create in batches, engage daily (sustainable)
