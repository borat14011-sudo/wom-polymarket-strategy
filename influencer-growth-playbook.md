- Share relevant content to stories

**30 Minutes After Posting:**
- Respond to every comment within first hour
- Reply to DMs mentioning your post
- Share post to stories with engagement prompt
- Send to close friends/community members

**Why it works:** Algorithm sees early engagement as signal to push content further.

---

### **Comment Strategy Framework**

**BAD Comments (Don't do this):**
- "Great post!"
- "Nice!"
- "🔥🔥🔥"
- "Check out my page!"

**GOOD Comments (Do this):**
- Add unique insight or perspective
- Ask thoughtful question
- Share personal experience related to post
- Tag someone who'd benefit
- 3+ sentences, genuine value

**Example:**
> "This reminds me of when I tried [related experience]. The part about [specific point] is so accurate - I found that [your insight]. Have you tried [thoughtful question]?"

---

### **DM Engagement Funnel**

**First Touch (New Follower):**
```
"Hey [Name]! Thanks for following along 🙏 

I'm curious - what type of [niche] content would be most valuable for you right now?

(No sales pitch, genuinely want to create content you'll love)"
```

**Engagement Follow-Up:**
```
"Saw you [saved/shared/commented] on my recent post about [topic]! 

That one was close to my heart. Are you currently working on [related challenge]?"
```

**Value-First DM:**
```
"Hey! I created a free [resource] for people in the [niche] space. 

Would you want me to send it over? It's got [specific benefit]."
```

**Collaboration Pitch:**
```
"Love your content on [topic]! 

I had an idea for a collab that could bring value to both our audiences - [brief description]. 

Open to chatting about it?"
```

---

### **The Engagement Loop Strategy**

1. **Post content** with engagement prompt (question, poll, fill-in-blank)
2. **Reply to every comment** within 2-4 hours
3. **Like all comments** (shows appreciation)
4. **Ask follow-up questions** in replies (extends conversation)
5. **Feature best comments** in Stories or future posts
6. **DM top engagers** with personal thank you or bonus content

**Result:** Teaches algorithm that your posts generate conversations = more reach.

---

**Power Replies:**

## 🚀 2024-2026 Algorithm Hacks

### **Universal Algorithm Principles (All Platforms)**

**The 3-Second Rule:**
Every platform's algorithm now prioritizes "stopping power." First 3 seconds determine 80% of reach.

**Hooks That Work in 2024-2026:**
- Pattern interrupts ("Don't do [common thing]...")
- Controversy (within reason): "Unpopular opinion:"
- Curiosity gaps: "The reason nobody talks about..."
- Direct call-outs: "If you're struggling with [X]..."
- Numbers: "3 things I wish I knew..."
- Personal stakes: "I lost $10K before learning..."

**The Save Signal:**
Saves are the new likes. Content that people want to reference later = high value signal.

**Create "Save-Worthy" Content:**
- Tutorials/how-tos
- Templates and frameworks
- Lists and resources
- Recipes/formulas
- Before-and-after transformations

**Completion Rate Dominance:**
If people watch/read to the end, algorithm amplifies. If they scroll away after 2 seconds, it's buried.

**Tactics:**
- Front-load value (no fluff intros)
- Pattern interrupts every 5-7 seconds (video)
- Cliffhangers mid-content
- Payoff at the very end
- Promise something specific in hook, deliver in finale

---

### **Instagram Algorithm Hacks (2024-2026)**

**Reels Domination Strategy:**
IG is fighting TikTok. Reels get 2-3x reach of static posts.

**Optimal Reel Formula:**
1. **0-3 sec:** Hook (text on screen + visual)
2. **3-10 sec:** Conflict or question setup
3. **10-25 sec:** Value delivery
4. **25-30 sec:** Payoff + CTA (follow for more, comment X, etc.)

**Audio Hack:**
- Use trending audio in first 24-48 hours of trend
- Check "Audio" page in Reels → "Trending" section
- Add your unique angle to trend (don't copy)

**Carousel Hack (High Save Rate):**
- 6-10 slides optimal
- First slide: Bold statement or question
- Slides 2-9: Value packed content
- Last slide: CTA (Save this, share with friend, follow for more)
- Use same template design (brand consistency)

**Story Engagement Hack:**
- More stories = more top-of-feed presence
- Use all interactive stickers (poll, question, quiz, slider)
- Reply to every DM from story interactions
- Post 10-15 stories/day minimum for max reach

**Posting Time Hack:**
- Post when your previous content performed best (check insights)
- Then IMMEDIATELY engage (comment on 10 posts in niche)
- Warm up the algorithm before you post

**Hashtag Strategy (2026 Update):**
- Use 3-5 highly relevant hashtags (not 30)
- Mix: 1 large (100K+ posts), 2 medium (10K-100K), 2 niche (under 10K)
- Create branded hashtag for community
- Hashtags in first comment vs. caption = no difference now

**The Collaboration Hack:**
- Use "Collab" feature (posts to both feeds)
- Partner with accounts slightly bigger than you
- Creates win-win reach amplification

---

### **TikTok Algorithm Hacks (2024-2026)**

**For You Page (FYP) Formula:**
TikTok's algo is interest-based, not follower-based. You can go viral with 0 followers.

**What TikTok Measures:**
1. **Watch time** (% of video watched)
2. **Completion rate** (did they finish?)
3. **Re-watch** (did they loop it?)
4. **Engagement** (comment, like, share)
5. **Share to friends** (highest signal - means it's REALLY good)

**FYP Hack Formula:**
- **0-1 sec:** Visual hook (face, movement, text)
- **1-3 sec:** Audio hook or statement
- **3-7 sec:** Setup or conflict
- **7-20 sec:** Payoff or resolution
- **Keep under 30 sec** for max completion

**Loop Hack:**
Make the end connect to the beginning so it auto-loops seamlessly.
Example: "...and that's why you should never [opens video again from start]"

**Sound Strategy (Critical):**
- Use sounds under 50K uses (early trend adoption)
- Check "Creative Center" for trending sounds in your region
- Original sounds can work BUT harder to get initial push

**Text Overlay Hack:**
- Add subtitles/captions (60% watch without sound)
- Use on-screen text for emphasis
- Text hooks: "Wait for it..." "This is crazy..." "Part 1..."

**Comment Seeding:**
Post a question or controversial statement in YOUR first comment.
Encourages others to comment, boosts engagement signal.

**Series/Part Strategy:**
"Part 1," "Part 2," etc. keeps people on your profile watching multiple videos.
TikTok rewards "session time" on your content.

**Best Time to Post Hack:**
Post 3-4 different times for first week, analyze what works for YOUR audience.
General rule: Post when people are free (lunch, after work, before bed).

**Going Viral Formula:**
- Relatable situation (broad appeal)
- Emotional hook (surprise, humor, shock, inspiration)
- Trend participation (your unique spin)
- Clear, simple message (anyone can understand in 3 seconds)

---

### **YouTube Algorithm Hacks (2024-2026)**

**CTR (Click-Through Rate) is King:**
If people don't click, you don't grow. Thumbnail + Title = 90% of your success.

**Thumbnail Hacks:**
- **Face close-up** with exaggerated expression (curiosity, shock, excitement)
- **High contrast** colors (bright vs. dark)
- **3-5 words max** on thumbnail text
- **Consistent style** (viewers recognize your videos)
- **Arrow/circle** pointing to key element (still works in 2026)

**Title Hacks:**
- **Front-load keywords** (first 40 characters shown in search)
- **Brackets work:** [Full Guide], [2026], [No BS]
- **Numbers:** "5 Ways..." "3 Mistakes..."
- **Power words:** Secret, Exposed, Finally, Never, Always
- **Curiosity gap:** "Why [expert] Never Does [common thing]"

**First 30 Seconds (Hook) Formula:**
1. **0-5 sec:** What video is about + why they should watch
2. **5-15 sec:** Tease the payoff ("By the end, you'll know...")
3. **15-30 sec:** Quick preview or pattern interrupt

**Retention Hack (AVD - Average View Duration):**
- **Pattern interrupts** every 30-60 seconds (zoom, cut, B-roll, text)
- **Open loops:** "But before I show you X, you need to know Y..."
- **Chapters:** Adds timestamps, allows people to skip to value
- **Mid-roll tease:** "The most important part is coming up..."

**End Screen & Cards:**
- Add end screen to promote next video (keep session time high)
- Mid-video cards to related videos
- YouTube rewards keeping viewers on platform

**Shorts Strategy (2026):**
- Post Shorts separate from long-form (different audiences)
- Shorts drive subscribers, long-form drives revenue
- Repurpose TikTok/IG Reels as Shorts
- Optimal: 3-5 Shorts per week

**SEO Hack:**
- Research keywords using VidIQ or TubeBuddy
- Use keyword in: Title, Description (first 2 lines), Tags, Spoken word (YT transcribes audio)
- Create "pillar content" targeting high-volume search terms

**Consistency Hack:**
- Post same day(s) every week (trains audience, boosts algorithm)
- Upload at same time (audience expects it)

### **LinkedIn Algorithm Hacks (2024-2026)**

**Dwell Time is Everything:**
How long do people stay on your post? That's the #1 signal.

**Dwell Time Hacks:**
- **Long-form text** (1,200-1,500 characters)
- **Line breaks** (white space keeps people reading)
- **Story structure** (beginning, middle, end)
- **Hook first line** (shows before "see more")

**Hook Examples:**
- "I lost my job 6 months ago. Today I signed a $500K deal."
- "Here's the email I sent that changed everything:"
- "Most people get this wrong about [topic]:"

**Carousel Dominance (2026):**
Carousels get 3-5x more engagement than single images.

**Carousel Best Practices:**
- **Slide 1:** Big bold statement or question
- **Slides 2-9:** Value breakdown (one point per slide)
- **Slide 10:** CTA (comment, share, follow, download)
- **Design:** Minimal text, consistent branding

**No-Link Rule:**
Don't put links in your initial post. Kills reach.
Instead: "Comment 'LINK' and I'll DM you" or put in first comment.

**Engagement Pod Strategy:**
Join 2-3 LinkedIn engagement groups (5-15 members).
Comment on each other's posts within first 30 minutes.
Boosts early engagement signal.

**Comment on Own Post:**
Wait 5-10 minutes, then comment on your own post with additional value.
Bumps it to top of feed for your network.

**Best Content Types (2026 LinkedIn):**
1. Personal stories (vulnerability + lesson)
2. Carousels (educational)
3. Contrarian takes (thoughtful, not edgy)
4. Case studies (results + process)
5. Lists/frameworks

**Hashtag Strategy:**
Use 3-5 hashtags:
- 1-2 broad (#Marketing, #Leadership)
- 2-3 niche (#B2BSaaS, #GrowthMarketing)

**Tagging Strategy:**
Tag people when genuinely relevant (not spammy).
They get notification → likely to engage → boosts your post.

---

### **Twitter/X Algorithm Hacks (2024-2026)**

**Blue Check Matters:**
Verified accounts get algorithmic boost. Worth the $8-11/month for reach.

**Engagement Velocity Hack:**
First 15-30 minutes determine if tweet goes viral.

**How to boost early engagement:**
1. Post at optimal time (when YOUR audience is active)
2. DM tweet to 5-10 engaged friends ("just posted this - would love your thoughts")
3. Reply to your own tweet with follow-up thought (encourages thread reads)
4. Quote tweet from secondary account (if you have one)

**Thread Strategy (High Reach):**
- **Tweet 1:** Hook (controversial, surprising, or valuable promise)
- **Tweets 2-8:** Deliver value, one point per tweet
- **Final tweet:** Recap + CTA ("RT the first tweet if..." or "Follow me for more...")

**Reply Guy Strategy:**
Find large accounts in your niche.
Reply with value-add comments in first 5 minutes of their tweets.
Their audience sees you → you gain followers.

**Dunking/Hot Takes:**
Controversial opinions get engagement.
BUT: Stay in your niche, don't alienate your audience, be thoughtful (not just edgy).

**Visual Tweets:**
Tweets with images/videos get 2-3x more engagement.
Infographics, memes, charts, screenshots all work.

**Time Gaps:**
Don't tweet every 5 minutes. Space tweets by 1-2 hours minimum.
Algorithm prioritizes your best tweet in that window.

**Pin Your Best:**
Pin your best-performing or most important tweet to profile top.
Converts profile visitors to followers.

---

### **Cross-Platform Amplification Hack**

**The Waterfall Strategy:**
1. Create long-form YouTube video
2. Extract 3-5 Shorts/TikToks/Reels from it
3. Pull quotes for Twitter/LinkedIn
4. Create carousel from key points (IG/LinkedIn)
5. Write blog post from transcript (SEO)
6. Create email newsletter from blog post
7. Share behind-the-scenes on Stories

**One piece of content → 20+ pieces of content.**

**Platform-Specific Optimization:**
Don't just cross-post the same thing. Adapt to each platform's format and culture.

## 💵 Rate Card Strategies

### **How to Price Your Influence (2024-2026 Standards)**

**Base Formula:**
**Price per post = (Follower count × $0.01) × Engagement rate multiplier**

**Engagement Rate Multipliers:**
- Under 2%: 0.5x
- 2-5%: 1x (baseline)
- 5-8%: 1.5x
- 8-12%: 2x
- 12%+: 2.5-3x

**Examples:**
- 10K followers, 6% engagement: (10,000 × $0.01) × 1.5 = $150 per post
- 50K followers, 4% engagement: (50,000 × $0.01) × 1 = $500 per post
- 100K followers, 10% engagement: (100,000 × $0.01) × 2 = $2,000 per post

**Note:** This is a starting baseline. Adjust based on:
- Niche (finance/B2B can charge 2-3x more than general lifestyle)
- Production quality
- Exclusivity
- Usage rights
- Campaign complexity

Hi [Brand],

Thanks so much for thinking of me! Unfortunately, [Product] isn't the right fit for my content focus right now.

Best,
[Your Name]

**[Reduced package]:**

- $[Their budget or slightly higher]

Alternatively, if you can stretch to $[mid-point between your ask and their offer], I can include [added value item].

Let me know what works best!

[Your Name]
