## Trading Strategy

**Focus on: <7 DAYS markets**

### Entry Signal
- Price drops >10% below 5-period moving average
- Price < 0.70 (avoid overpriced markets)

### Position Management
- Target return: 66%+
- Expected hold time: 1 hours
- Expected IRR: 1000000%/year

### Why This Works
1. **Mean Reversion:** Panic selling creates overshoots
2. **Fast Recovery:** Short timeframes = quick turnaround
3. **High IRR:** Fast recovery converts modest gains to high annualized returns
4. **Frequency:** Multiple opportunities per market

## Risk Considerations

- This analysis looks at mean reversion on YES tokens
- Actual market resolution matters (only works if YES wins)
- High frequency trading requires active monitoring
- Transaction costs and slippage not modeled
