- **Implementation Checklist:** 3-phase deployment plan

**CONFLICTS/CONCERNS:** Agent 2's expected returns (25-150%) are higher than Agent 4's assessment (10-20% realistic). Will need reconciliation at synthesis.

### AGENT 3 - Technical Implementation (c70dc1d6)
**Status:** PENDING FIRST CHECK-IN
**Progress:** 0%
**Findings:** Awaiting initial report...

### AGENT 4 - Risk & Edge Analysis (45c8bbc6)
**Status:** 🟢 ACTIVE - OUTPUT DELIVERED
**Progress:** 80%
**Findings:** Comprehensive risk analysis document (WHALE_RISKS.md) created

**KEY FINDINGS FROM AGENT 4:**
- **10 Failure Modes:** Latecomer tax, information asymmetry, time horizon mismatches, testing traps, hedge confusion, exit velocity problems, market impact, pump & exploits, survivorship bias, regulatory risks
- **Protection Strategies:** Validation filters (100+ trades, >55% win rate, $25K+ size), position sizing (max 5% per signal, 20% total), stop mechanisms
- **Red Flags:** Whale behavior changes, CEX-heavy activity, wash trading patterns
- **Sustainability Analysis:** Edge decay phases (Pioneer → Commoditized), currently in Early Adopter/Mainstream transition
- **Honest Assessment:** Expected returns 10-20% (realistic case), Sharpe 0.3-0.6, 40-60% max drawdowns
- **Final Verdict:** "Viable but overrated" - edge is thinner than marketed, risks underestimated

**CONFLICTS/CONCERNS:** None yet - waiting for other agent outputs to compare
