## 🔥 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (Next 48 Hours)

### TODAY - CPI Release (8:30 AM ET) ⚡
**HIGHEST PRIORITY TRADE**
- **If CPI hot:** Short "Fed cuts in March" (currently 7% → likely 2-3%)
- **If CPI soft:** Long "Bitcoin $75k by Feb end" (currently 28% → could hit 40%+)

## ⚠️ RED FLAGS

1. **Market Manipulation Risk:** Elon tweet markets ($16M) - he could game his own bets
2. **Regulatory Patchwork:** Massachusetts restricting sports betting (state-by-state variance)
3. **International Bans:** Portugal blocked Polymarket (Jan 20) - trend spreading?

---

## 🎯 EDGE OPPORTUNITIES

### Where Retail Is Dumb:
1. **New Coinbase markets** - unsophisticated participants flooding in
2. **Niche markets** (Bernie speech, tweet counts) - data can beat opinion
3. **Entertainment markets** - less efficient than political markets

### Where To Avoid:
1. **High-volume Fed markets** ($97M) = too efficient, sharp money
2. **Low liquidity** (<$100k) unless unique edge
3. **Insider-advantage markets** (celebrity behavior, influencer actions)
