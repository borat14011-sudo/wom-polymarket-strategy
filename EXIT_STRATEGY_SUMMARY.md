## 🏆 WINNER: Volatility-Based Stops

**Performance:**
- **Return:** +0.51% (vs -0.84% current)
- **Profit Factor:** 2.12 (vs 0.14 current) - **15x improvement**
- **Win Rate:** 95.5% (vs 28.6% current)
- **Max Drawdown:** 12.9% (acceptable)
- **Risk-Adjusted Score:** 0.164 (best)

**Why it wins:**
1. **Adapts to market conditions** - tighter 8% stops on low-volume markets prevent large losses
2. **High consistency** - 95.5% win rate means almost every trade is profitable
3. **Balanced risk** - 12.9% drawdown is manageable for 2.12 profit factor
4. **Removes time decay** - lets winners run instead of cutting them early

## ⚠️ Current Strategy Issues

Your current strategy (12% stop + tiered profits + time decay) is **LOSING MONEY**:

| Problem | Impact | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Time decay exits at 3-7 days | Cuts winners before TP levels | Remove time decay |
| No volume adjustment | Same stops for all markets | Use 8% stops on low volume |
| Only 28.6% win rate | More losers than winners | Better exit timing |
| -0.84% return | Losing capital | Switch to volatility-based |

**Root cause:** Time decay forces exits before trades can reach 8%/15%/25% take-profit targets.

## 🚀 Implementation

### Option 1: Volatility-Based (Recommended)

```python
def get_stop_loss(volume_24h):
    return 0.08 if volume_24h < 10000 else 0.12

# Same take-profits: 8%, 15%, 25%
# Same allocations: 25%, 50%, 25%
# NO time decay
```

**Use when:**
- You want highest win rate (95.5%)
- Capital preservation is important
- You trade both high and low volume markets

### Option 2: Trailing Stop (Alternative)

```python
# Start with 12% stop
# When +10% profit, move stop to breakeven
# Trail by 5% from highest price
```

**Use when:**
- You want to maximize winning trades
- Okay with slightly higher drawdown (16%)
- Prefer simpler logic

### Option 3: Hybrid (Aggressive)

```python
# Combine both:
# - Use volatility-based stops
# - Add trailing stop after +10%
# - Exit at 80% of time if still open
```

**Use when:**
- You want best of all worlds
- Can handle complexity
- Testing in paper trading first
