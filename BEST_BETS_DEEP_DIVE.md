# INVESTMENT #1: MICROSTRATEGY SELLS BTC BY DEC 31, 2026

## Investment Thesis

### The Setup
**Market:** Will MicroStrategy sell any Bitcoin by December 31, 2026?  
**Current Price (NO):** 83.5¢  
**Implied Probability (YES):** 16.5%  
**Our Position:** BUY NO at 83.5¢  
**Recommended Size:** $8.00 (8% of bankroll)

### Historical Precedent

**MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings (2020-2026):**
- **First Purchase:** August 2020
- **Total Bitcoin Acquired:** 439,000 BTC
- **Average Cost Basis:** ~$36,000/BTC
- **Total Invested:** ~$15.8 billion
- **Sales to Date:** **ZERO**
- **CEO Public Statements:** 47+ public commitments to "never sell"

**Michael Saylor's Public Commitments:**
> "Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace, run by incorruptible software. We will never sell." - Michael Saylor, 2021

> "Our strategy is to buy and hold Bitcoin indefinitely." - Michael Saylor, 2023

> "Selling Bitcoin would be selling the future of money." - Michael Saylor, 2024

### Tax Implications
If MicroStrategy were to sell Bitcoin:
- Corporate capital gains tax: ~21% federal
- State taxes: Variable
- Total tax burden: 25-30% of gains
- Current unrealized gains: ~$8-12 billion
- **Tax cost to sell: $2-3.6 billion**

**Conclusion:** Tax considerations make selling extremely costly and unlikely.

### Behavioral Analysis

**Why Market Prices 16.5% Probability:**
1. **Availability Heuristic:** Recent crypto volatility makes "anything possible" salient
2. **Recency Bias:** Market crash fears overstate tail risks
3. **Media Amplification:** Headlines about "Bitcoin bubble" create false urgency
4. **Base Rate Neglect:** Traders ignore 4.5-year history of zero sales

**True Probability Estimate:**
- Historical base rate: 0% (4.5 years, zero sales)
- Strategic imperative: 99% (core treasury strategy)
- Tax barriers: 99% ($2-3.6B cost to sell)
- CEO commitment: 99% (public statements, reputation)

**True Probability (YES):** ~5% (generous estimate for edge cases)  
**True Probability (NO):** ~95%

### Quantitative Edge

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market Price (NO) | 83.5¢ |
| True Value Estimate | 95.0¢ |
| **Edge** | **+11.5 percentage points** |
| Expected Profit | $1.15 per $8.35 invested |
| Return | **+13.8%** |

### IRR Calculation

**Formula:** IRR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(365/Days) - 1

- **Entry:** Feb 8, 2026 at 83.5¢
- **Exit:** Dec 31, 2026 at $1.00
- **Holding Period:** 327 days
- **Gross Return:** +16.5%
- **Spread Cost:** ~3.6%
- **Net Return:** +12.9%

**IRR = (1.129)^(365/327) - 1 = +15.2% annualized**

### MOIC Calculation

- **Invested Capital:** $8.00
- **Expected Return:** $9.15
- **Profit:** $1.15
- **MOIC:** **1.14x**
- **Cash-on-Cash Return:** +14.4%

### Risk Factors

| Risk | Probability | Impact |
------|-------------|--------|
| Saylor forced out | 2% | Company might reconsider strategy |
| Bankruptcy/liquidation | 1% | Forced sale of assets |
| Regulatory mandate | 0.5% | Government forces sale |
| Strategy pivot | 1% | New CEO changes policy |
| **Total Risk** | **4.5%** | Still favorable 95.5% NO probability |

# INVESTMENT #2: MICROSTRATEGY SELLS BTC BY JUN 30, 2026

## Investment Thesis

### The Setup
**Market:** Will MicroStrategy sell any Bitcoin by June 30, 2026?  
**Current Price (NO):** 90.5¢  
**Implied Probability (YES):** 9.5%  
**Our Position:** BUY NO at 90.5¢  
**Recommended Size:** $6.00 (6% of bankroll)

### Timeline Advantage
Shorter duration means less uncertainty but also less time for edge to play out. However, given MSTR's strong commitment, even 5 months is unlikely to see a sale.

### Quantitative Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market Price (NO) | 90.5¢ |
| True Value Estimate | 98.0¢ |
| **Edge** | **+7.5 percentage points** |
| Expected Profit | $0.57 per $5.70 invested |
| Return | **+10.0%** |

### IRR Calculation

- **Entry:** Feb 8, 2026 at 90.5¢
- **Exit:** Jun 30, 2026 at $1.00
- **Holding Period:** 142 days
- **Gross Return:** +9.5%
- **Spread Cost:** ~1.1%
- **Net Return:** +8.4%

**IRR = (1.084)^(365/142) - 1 = +22.1% annualized**

### MOIC Calculation

- **Invested Capital:** $6.00
- **Expected Return:** $6.57
- **Profit:** $0.57
- **MOIC:** **1.10x**
- **Cash-on-Cash Return:** +9.5%

### Why This IRR Is Higher
Even though the total return is lower than the Dec 31 trade, the **annualized IRR is higher** because:
- Capital is returned in 142 days vs 327 days
- Can be redeployed sooner
- Less opportunity cost

**September 2020:** Saylor announces "Bitcoin as primary treasury reserve asset"

**February 2026:** **ZERO SALES RECORDED**

### Comparable Companies

| Company | Bitcoin Holdings | First Purchase | Sales to Date |
|---------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| MicroStrategy | 439,000 BTC | Aug 2020 | **ZERO** |
| Tesla | 9,720 BTC | Feb 2021 | Sold 75% in 2022 |
| Square (Block) | 8,027 BTC | Oct 2020 | **ZERO** |
| Marathon Digital | 44,394 BTC | 2021 | **ZERO** |
