## EMAIL 2: Problem (Traveling with Baby is HARD)
**TIMING:** Day 2 (48 hours after signup)

**Subject Line:** 😰 My sister's baby disaster in Madrid (very sad story)

**Preview Text:** She not have right information. Baby cry, husband leave, marriage nearly ruined...

**Body Copy:**

My friend,

I must tell you story. Is sad story, but important.

Last year my sister Natalya go to Madrid with baby. She very excite! She pack 47 diapers, 3 strollers, baby food for entire army.

**THEN DISASTER STRIKE:**

Day 1 - She cannot fit giant American stroller on Madrid metro. Have to carry baby, stroller, and bags up 87 steps. Husband's back broken (not really, but he complain for 6 months).

Day 2 - Baby refuse eat Spanish food. They not know which restaurants have baby facilities. Spend €200 on taxi finding place with changing table.

Day 3 - They go to famous plaza. Baby have diaper explosion. No bathroom for 400 meters. I cannot describe what happen next... is too traumatic.

Day 4 - Baby not sleep because hotel have noise and strange bed. Parents not sleep. Marriage nearly collapse.

**She spend entire vacation stressed, tired, and crying more than baby.**

Why this happen? 

Because Natalya not have SISTEM. She not know:
- ❌ Which neighborhoods are baby-friendly (and which ones will destroy your soul)
- ❌ Secret baby hacks Spanish parents use every day
- ❌ How to use Madrid like local parent, not stupid tourist
- ❌ Where find emergency supplies at 11pm when baby decide throw tantrum
- ❌ Best restaurants, hotels, and activities that ACTUALLY work with babies

**You know what most sad part?**

These informations exist. I have them. Spanish parents have them. But tourists? They suffer because they not know.

I think about Natalya when I create my Madrid Baby Travel Guide. I think "never again should parent suffer like my sister."

Tomorrow I show you how my guide work. Is very nice. You will like.

Do svidaniya,
Borat

P.S. - Natalya husband still bring up "Madrid disaster" at family dinners. Very awkward.

---

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **David & Sarah K. - Austin, Texas**  
*"This guide is INSANE. We saved at least €400 by knowing where to shop, which areas to stay, and avoiding tourist trap restaurants. Our baby slept better in Madrid than at home?! Still don't know how that happened. Thank you Borat!"*

---

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Priya S. - London, UK**
*"Honestly thought this would be gimmicky because of the funny style, but it's the most PRACTICAL travel guide I've ever used. The restaurant database alone is worth €47. We found 4 amazing baby-friendly places in our neighborhood within 10 minutes."*

---

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Michael R. - Sydney, Australia**  
*"Mate, this guide is brilliant. Followed the 3-day itinerary and our toddler actually ENJOYED sightseeing. Didn't think that was possible. Wife is already planning our next Spain trip."*

---

These parents invest €47. They get back 10x value. They have amazing trips. Babies happy. Parents happy. Marriage strong.

**NOW HERE IS PROBLEM...**

My wife say I am "giving too much discount." She say €47 is "insulting to my work" (she not wrong, I work very hard on this).

So she FORCE me to raise price to €77 on Friday night.

**That give you 48 hours to get special price.**

After Friday 11:59pm (Madrid time), price go up €30. Forever.

You can wait and pay more. Is your choice. Is free country (unlike Kazakhstan, where choice is illegal).

OR...

You can get guide NOW for €47, save €30, and start planning amazing Madrid trip TONIGHT.

👉 **[YES BORAT, I WANT €47 PRICE NOW]**

**ALSO - SPECIAL BONUS IF YOU GET TODAY:**

I add FREE bonus guide: "Madrid to Barcelona Baby Travel" (€27 value)

Many people go Madrid THEN Barcelona. This bonus show you how to travel between cities with baby. Train vs plane. Best routes. Where sit. Everything.

But this bonus disappear Friday. Wife say I am "hemorrhaging money with free bonuses." She use big words when angry.

**To summarize:**
- ✅ Get guide NOW = €47 + free Barcelona bonus
- ❌ Wait until Saturday = €77 + no bonus

Mathematics is simple, even for my small Kazakh brain.

What you choose?

Chenquieh,
Borat
