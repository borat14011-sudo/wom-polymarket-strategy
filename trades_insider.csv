# DATA UNAVAILABLE - HISTORICAL BACKTEST CANNOT BE COMPLETED
# 
# This file would contain ~400-800 trades over 2-year period (2024-02-07 to 2026-02-07)
# 
# Reason for unavailability:
# 1. Polysights historical alerts require Twitter API v2 (paid tier $100-500/mo)
# 2. Polymarket historical trader positions not accessible via public API
# 3. Goldsky blockchain indexing requires infrastructure setup (4-8 hours)
# 4. No archived historical odds/position data available
# 
# Expected data structure:
# - trade_id: Unique identifier (e.g., PS_2024_001 for Polysights, WHALE_2024_001 for whale copy)
# - date: Entry timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)
# - source: "polysights" or "whale_copy"
# - trader_address: If whale copy, the trader's wallet address (0x...)
# - market_id: Polymarket market identifier
# - market_name: Human-readable market name
# - direction: "YES" or "NO"
# - entry_price: Probability at entry (0.0 to 1.0)
# - entry_odds: Decimal odds at entry
# - position_size_usd: Normalized position size ($1000 standard for backtest)
# - exit_date: Exit timestamp
# - exit_price: Probability at exit
# - exit_odds: Decimal odds at exit
# - pnl_usd: Profit/loss in USD
# - pnl_pct: Profit/loss percentage
# - exit_reason: "profit_target" (+20%), "whale_exit", "resolution", "max_hold" (30 days)
# - win: TRUE/FALSE
# - notes: Additional context (e.g., "Alert had 500 retweets", "Whale position $5M")
#
# Expected metrics from 2-year backtest (if data available):
# - Total trades: ~400-800
# - Win rate: 70-85% (based on claims)
# - Avg win: +15%
# - Avg loss: -8%
# - Total return: +120% to +180%
# - Sharpe ratio: 1.5-2.5 (estimated)
# - Max drawdown: -15% to -25%
#
# ALTERNATIVE: Forward testing data collection started 2026-02-07
# Run this script for 30-90 days to populate with REAL data:
# 
# Polysights monitoring:
#   - Track @polysights Twitter alerts
#   - Log entry timestamp, market, direction
#   - Track outcome when market resolves
#
# Whale tracking:
#   - Monitor top 20 leaderboard traders daily
#   - Detect new positions via position size changes
#   - Log entry/exit prices from blockchain or API
#
# Forward testing recommended timeline:
#   - Days 1-30: Data collection only (no real money)
#   - Days 31-60: Paper trading with virtual $100K
#   - Days 61-90: Small capital test ($1K-5K real)
#   - Days 91+: Scale if performance validates claims
#
# Status: AWAITING DATA - Recommend forward testing approach
