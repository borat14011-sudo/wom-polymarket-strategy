VALIDATION AGENT - KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY

MISSION: Cross-validate patterns against ground truth data

DATA ANALYZED:
1. RESOLVED_DATA_FIXED.json - Claims 100% favorite win rate (FALSE)
2. backtest_analysis.csv - 2,015 actual trades with P&L
3. polymarket_resolved_markets.csv - Additional market data

CRITICAL DISCOVERY:
The claimed "100% favorite win rate" is COMPLETELY FALSE.

ACTUAL PERFORMANCE:
- Overall favorite win rate: 54.0%
- Best strategy favorite win rate: 82.0% (Whale Copy)
- High probability trades (≥90%): Win only 47.7% of the time
- Low probability trades (≤10%): Win 31.1% of the time

TOP STRATEGIES (by P&L):
1. Whale Copy: $33.84 profit, 82.0% win rate
2. Trend Filter: $23.79 profit, 57.3% win rate
3. Expert Fade: $17.57 profit, 14.0% win rate (high risk)

STRATEGIES TO AVOID:
- Time Horizon: Lost $28.32, 45.2% win rate

RISK PROFILE:
- Maximum Drawdown: -100% (total loss possible)
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.35 (modest risk-adjusted returns)
- Average trade ROI: 63.22% but median is -9.15% (skewed by few big wins)

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. Markets are NOT efficient as claimed
2. High probability trades are overconfident
3. Low probability trades have more value than expected
4. Risk management is CRITICAL (100% loss possible)
5. Original analysis dangerously misleading

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use Whale Copy and Trend Filter strategies
- Implement strict position sizing (1-2% max per trade)
- Never assume 100% win rate for any trade
- Monitor performance monthly
- Diversify across multiple strategies

CONCLUSION: The original claims are empirically false. Real trading requires realistic expectations and robust risk management.
