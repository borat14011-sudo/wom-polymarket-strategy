# INVESTMENT #4: TRUMP DEPORTS 1M-1.5M IN 2025

## Investment Thesis

### The Setup
**Market:** Will ICE deport 1,000,000-1,499,999 people in 2025?  
**Expected Price (NO):** ~98.5¢  
**Implied Probability (YES):** ~1.5%  
**Our Position:** BUY NO  
**Recommended Size:** $4.00 (4% of bankroll)

### Historical Precedent Analysis

**ICE Deportation History (FY Data):**

| Fiscal Year | Administration | Deportations | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| 2016 | Obama | 433,000 | Peak enforcement year |
| 2017 | Trump 1.0 | 226,000 | Transition year |
| 2018 | Trump 1.0 | 256,000 | Full enforcement |
| 2019 | Trump 1.0 | 268,000 | Consistent |
| 2020 | Trump 1.0 | 186,000 | COVID impact |
| 2021 | Biden | 59,000 | Low enforcement |
| 2022 | Biden | 72,000 | Low enforcement |
| 2023 | Biden | 142,000 | Increased |
| 2024 | Biden | 271,000 | Record for Biden era |

**Key Statistics:**
- Historical Maximum: 433,000 (2016, Obama administration)
- Trump 1.0 Average: 247,000/year
- Infrastructure Limit: ~300,000/year (detention capacity, flights, courts)
- Target: 1,000,000-1,499,999

### The Math

To deport 1M+ people in 2025:
- Required rate: 83,333/month
- Historical max month: ~36,000 (Obama 2016)
- **Required vs Max: 2.3x historical capacity**

**Infrastructure Constraints:**
1. **Detention Space:** ~40,000 beds nationwide
2. **ICE Personnel:** ~20,000 agents
3. **Immigration Courts:** 600 judges, 3+ year backlog
4. **Flight Capacity:** Limited charter availability
5. **Diplomatic Agreements:** Many countries refuse deportation flights

### Why Market Overprices YES

**Behavioral Biases at Play:**
1. **Availability Heuristic:** Recent news about "mass deportation plans" makes extreme outcomes seem likely
2. **Anchoring:** Campaign rhetoric of "millions" anchors expectations too high
3. **Probability Neglect:** Small probabilities (1.5%) feel larger than they are
4. **Media Amplification:** News focuses on plans, not logistical reality

### Quantitative Edge

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market Implied (YES) | 1.5% |
| True Probability Estimate | 0.5% |
| **Edge** | **+1.0 percentage point** |
| Historical Base Rate | 0% (never achieved) |
| Infrastructure Max | 0.3% probability |

**Expected Value Calculation:**
```
EV = (Win Prob × Win Amount) - (Loss Prob × Loss Amount)
   = (0.985 × $0.015) - (0.015 × $0.985)
   = $0.0148 - $0.0148
   = ~$0.00 (break-even at market price)

With True Probability:
EV = (0.995 × $0.015) - (0.005 × $0.985)
   = $0.0149 - $0.0049
   = +$0.010 per $1 invested (+1.0%)
```

**Adjusted for Position Size ($4):**
- Expected Profit: $0.04
- IRR: Modest but positive

### IRR Calculation

- **Entry:** Feb 2026 at 98.5¢
- **Exit:** Dec 31, 2025 at $1.00
- **Holding Period:** ~300 days
- **Expected Return:** +1.5%
- **IRR:** **+1.8% annualized**

**Note:** This is a **low-return, high-certainty** hedge position. Primary value is portfolio diversification.

### MOIC Calculation

- **Invested:** $4.00
- **Expected Return:** $4.06
- **MOIC:** **1.02x**
- **Cash-on-Cash:** +1.5%

### Risk Factors

| Risk | Probability | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Emergency powers declared | <1% | Could bypass normal constraints |
| Mass self-deportation | 2% | Voluntary departures count |
| Data manipulation | <1% | Counting methods changed |
| **Total Risk** | **<4%** | Still favorable 96% NO probability |

2. **Strategy Validation:** Tests WEATHER_FADE in political markets
3. **Capital Preservation:** Near-certain 1.5% return beats savings accounts
4. **Data Collection:** Builds track record for future political bets

# INVESTMENT #5: TRUMP DEPORTS 1.5M-2M IN 2025

## Investment Thesis

### The Setup
**Market:** Will ICE deport 1,500,000-1,999,999 people in 2025?  
**Expected Price (NO):** ~99.0¢  
**Implied Probability (YES):** ~1.0%  
**Our Position:** BUY NO  
**Recommended Size:** $3.00 (3% of bankroll)

### Quantitative Analysis

| Metric | 1.5M-2M Target | Historical Max | Multiple |
|--------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Required Annual | 1,750,000 | 433,000 (2016) | **4.0x** |
| Required Monthly | 146,000 | 36,000 | **4.1x** |
| Required Daily | 4,800 | 1,200 | **4.0x** |

**Infrastructure Reality Check:**
- To deport 1.75M people requires processing **4,800 people per day, every day**
- Current ICE capacity: ~1,200/day sustained
- Gap: **4x capacity expansion required**

### Historical Comparison

**Countries with Similar Deportation Scale:**
- No developed country has ever deported >500K/year
- China's Xinjiang internment: ~1M (over 5+ years, not deportations)
- WWII Japanese internment: ~120K (US, 1942)
- **Conclusion:** 1.5M+ deportations in one year is historically unprecedented in modern democracies

### Expected Value

| Scenario | Probability | Payout | Weighted Value |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| NO wins | 99.5% | +$0.01 | +$0.00995 |
| YES wins | 0.5% | -$0.99 | -$0.00495 |
| **Expected Value** | | | **+$0.005 per $1** (+0.5%) |

### IRR Calculation

- **Expected Return:** +1.0%
- **Holding Period:** 300 days
- **IRR:** **+1.2% annualized**

### MOIC

- **MOIC:** 1.01x
- **Cash-on-Cash:** +1.0%

# INVESTMENT #6: TRUMP DEPORTS >3M IN 2025

## Investment Thesis

### The Setup
**Market:** Will ICE deport 3,000,000+ people in 2025?  
**Expected Price (NO):** ~99.5¢  
**Implied Probability (YES):** ~0.5%  
**Our Position:** BUY NO  
**Recommended Size:** $2.00 (2% of bankroll)

### Extreme Scenario Analysis

**3M+ Deportations Would Require:**
- **10,000 people per day, every day**
- **300,000 people per month**
- **36x Obama-era peak capacity**
- **Population of Chicago removed in 1 year**

**Comparison to Historical Atrocities:**
- Armenian Genocide: 1-1.5M deaths (1915-1917)
- Cambodian Genocide: 1.7-2.2M deaths (1975-1979)
- **3M deportations would be largest forced population movement in modern history**

### Probability Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Logistical Feasibility | Impossible with current infrastructure |
| Political Feasibility | Would require martial law, concentration camps |
| Legal Feasibility | Massive constitutional challenges |
| International Feasibility | Sanctions, diplomatic isolation |
| **Combined Probability** | **<0.1%** |

### Expected Value

| Scenario | Probability | Payout | Weighted Value |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| NO wins | 99.9% | +$0.005 | +$0.004995 |
| YES wins | 0.1% | -$0.995 | -$0.000995 |
| **Expected Value** | | | **+$0.004 per $1** (+0.4%) |

### IRR & MOIC

- **Expected Return:** +0.5%
- **IRR:** **+0.6% annualized**
- **MOIC:** 1.005x

### Why This Bet Matters

**Portfolio Insurance:**
- If extreme political events occur, this bet hedges tail risk
- Provides liquidity in catastrophic scenarios
- Psychological benefit of "black swan" protection

# EXECUTION PLAN

## Phase 1: Immediate (Today)
Execute initial 3 MSTR bets:
- [ ] MSTR Mar 31: $6
- [ ] MSTR Jun 30: $6
- [ ] MSTR Dec 31: $8

## Phase 2: Verify Markets (This Week)
Check Polymarket for deportation markets:
- [ ] Search: "Trump deport 1 million"
- [ ] Search: "ICE deportations 2025"
- [ ] Verify markets are active and liquid
- [ ] Check minimum order sizes

## Phase 3: Deploy Additional Capital (If Markets Exist)
- [ ] Deport 1M-1.5M: $4
- [ ] Deport 1.5M-2M: $3
- [ ] Deport >3M: $2

## Phase 4: Monitor & Rebalance
- Monthly: Check deportation numbers vs projections
- Quarterly: Reassess probabilities based on actual data
- If deportations tracking >500K/year: Consider early exit

---

# RISK MANAGEMENT

## Circuit Breakers

**Exit All Deportation Bets If:**
1. Actual deportations exceed 50K in any month
2. Emergency powers declared
3. Mass detention camps established
4. Legal challenges fail at Supreme Court

**Early Exit Strategy:**
- Markets are liquid enough to exit early
- Early exit likely at 95-98¢ (small loss vs holding to 0)
- Better to preserve capital than hope for reversal

## Correlation Monitoring

**If MSTR and Deportation Bets Become Correlated:**
- Unlikely (different asset classes)
- If correlation >0.5: Reduce position sizes
- If correlation >0.7: Exit deportation bets

---

# HISTORICAL PRECEDENT

## Can Trump Actually Deport 1M+ People?

### The Math

**Required Infrastructure for 1M Deportations:**

| Resource | Current Capacity | Required | Gap |
|----------|------------------|----------|-----|
| Detention beds | 40,000 | 200,000 | 5x |
| ICE agents | 20,000 | 100,000 | 5x |
| Immigration judges | 600 | 3,000 | 5x |
| Deportation flights/day | 10 | 50 | 5x |
| Processing facilities | 200 | 1,000 | 5x |

**Budget Required:**
- Current ICE budget: $8.7B/year
- Estimated cost per deportation: $10,000-15,000
- Cost for 1M deportations: $10-15B
- **Required budget increase: 115-172%**

### Political Reality

**Congressional Approval Required:**
- House: Republican majority (likely supports)
- Senate: 60 votes needed (unlikely)
- Budget reconciliation: Possible but politically costly

**Legal Challenges:**
- ACLU lawsuits: Immediate injunctions likely
- State challenges: Blue states will resist
- International law: Violates refugee conventions

**Timeline:**
- Even with full cooperation: 3-5 years to build capacity
- Without cooperation: Impossible

### Conclusion

**1M+ deportations in 2025 is statistically near-impossible.**

Historical maximum: 433K (Obama, 2016)  
Infrastructure maximum: ~300K/year  
Political maximum: ~500K/year (with massive effort)  
**Target: 1M+ deportations**  

**Verdict: Market pricing 1.5% is too high. True probability: <0.5%.**
