POLYMARKET PRICING: HOW CENTS TRANSLATE TO PROBABILITY
======================================================

THE BASIC RULE
==============

Polymarket prices ARE implied probabilities:

  Price in cents = Probability percentage

  11 cents = 11% probability
  50 cents = 50% probability  
  89 cents = 89% probability


BINARY MARKETS (YES/NO)
=======================

Every market has two outcomes that sum to $1.00:

  YES price + NO price = 100 cents

Example - "Will it rain?"
  YES: 30 cents (30% chance of rain)
  NO:  70 cents (70% chance of no rain)
  Total: 100 cents


HOW YOU MAKE MONEY
==================

Buy shares at current price, get $1.00 if correct.

Example 1 - Buy YES at 30 cents:
  Cost: 30 cents per share
  If YES wins: Get $1.00
  Profit: 70 cents per share
  Return: 70/30 = 233%

Example 2 - Buy NO at 70 cents:
  Cost: 70 cents per share
  If NO wins: Get $1.00
  Profit: 30 cents per share
  Return: 30/70 = 43%


KEY PRINCIPLE
=============

Cheap shares (low price) = High risk, HIGH REWARD
Expensive shares (high price) = Low risk, LOW REWARD

  10 cents = 10% probability = 900% return if right
  90 cents = 90% probability = 11% return if right


THE TRADER'S EDGE
=================

You profit when you DISAGREE with the market:

  Market says: 11% chance (priced at 11 cents)
  You believe: 35% chance (true probability)
  
  Action: BUY at 11 cents
  
  If you're right and price moves to 35 cents:
  You can sell early at 35 cents
  Profit: 24 cents per share (218% return)
  
  OR hold to resolution for full $1.00
  Profit: 89 cents per share (809% return)


TARIFF MARKET EXAMPLE
=====================

Market: "Will tariff revenue be $200-500B in 2025?"

Market prices:
  YES: 11 cents (market thinks 11% chance)
  NO:  89 cents (market thinks 89% chance)

Market is saying: "Very unlikely to hit $200-500B"

Our thesis: "Actually 35% likely due to March 12 tariffs"

So we BUY YES at 11 cents because:
  - Market underpricing at 11 cents
  - True value closer to 35 cents
  - 24 cents of edge per share

If we're right: 218% to 809% return
If we're wrong: Lose ~97% of investment


COMMON CONFUSION
================

Question: "If NO is at 89 cents, doesn't that mean 89% chance of NO?"

Answer: YES, exactly!

  NO at 89 cents = 89% chance event does NOT happen
  YES at 11 cents = 11% chance event DOES happen

  Total: 89% + 11% = 100%

We're betting the 11% side because we think the true chance is higher.


WHY NOT BET NO AT 89 CENTS?
===========================

You could! But:
  - 89 cents is expensive
  - After 2% entry fee: 90.8 cents cost
  - After 2% exit fee: Get 98 cents
  - Net profit: 7.2 cents per share
  - Return: 8% (not worth the risk)

Plus slippage at extreme prices makes it even worse.


SUMMARY
=======

1. Price in cents = Implied probability
2. YES price + NO price = 100 cents
3. Buy LOW price for HIGH returns (if right)
4. Buy HIGH price for LOW returns (safer but barely profitable)
5. Your edge = Your probability estimate - Market's price

In our tariff bet:
  Market: 11 cents (11% implied)
  Us:     35 cents (35% estimated)
  Edge:   24 cents (24 percentage points)

That's why it's a good bet (if our 35% estimate is correct).


RISK REMINDER
=============

If market is RIGHT and we're WRONG:
  - YES stays cheap or gets cheaper
  - We lose most/all of our $2.50
  - NO at 89 cents was the right bet

The entire edge depends on our analysis being better than the market's.
