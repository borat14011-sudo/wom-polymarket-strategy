The introduction, proposal, or announcement of such a policy without legal enactment will not qualify.\n\nThe enactment of a policy that initiates a structured increase of the minimum wage to at least $30 an hour in NYC over the course of several years will qualify for an immediate \"Yes\" resolution, so long as that policy explicitly outlines it will achieve that level by the stated date.\n\nEnactment of limited or temporary pilots which are not formally intended for citywide expansion (e.g., policies that explicitly cover only select boroughs, neighborhoods, or time periods) will not count.\n\nPolicies which include limited exceptions—such as such as exceptions for restaurant workers, etc.—will still qualify as long as a general policy of a $30 per hour minimum wage in New York City by 2030 is enacted.\n\nIf Mamdani is confirmed to have lost the 2025 NYC Mayoral election by a consensus of credible reporting, or if the stated terms are not satisfied within this market's timeframe, this market will immediately resolve to “No”.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting.","market_slug":"will-mamdani-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-30-before-2027","end_date_iso":"2026-12-31T00:00:00Z","game_start_time":null,"seconds_delay":0,"fpmm":"","maker_base_fee":0,"taker_base_fee":0,"notifications_enabled":true,"neg_risk":false,"neg_risk_market_id":"","neg_risk_request_id":"","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-mamdani-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-30-before-2027-MfedQlxki60R.jpg","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-mamdani-raise-the-minimum-wage-to-30-before-2027-MfedQlxki60R.jpg","rewards":{"rates":[{"asset_address":"0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174","rewards_daily_rate":1}],"min_size":100,"max_spread":4.5},"is_50_50_outcome":false,"tokens":[{"token_id":"71061461875209900766812068768816681292193805160628503277918359666928040556326","outcome":"Yes","price":0.13,"winner":false},{"token_id":"100541036509719227144678902409316822196590814611525765232708914691661660573802","outcome":"No","price":0.87,"winner":false}],"tags":["Politics","New York City","NYC Mayor","Mamdani"]},{"enable_order_book":true,"active":true,"closed":false,"archived":false,"accepting_orders":true,"accepting_order_timestamp":"2025-11-25T21:55:05Z","minimum_order_size":5,"minimum_tick_size":0.01,"condition_id":"0x89c32a0f93d0fb5b46225e4ac76f3e00a8614f55e6aa365e0152d5ee92722a81","question_id":"0x621cbfd923ae0b292a28b1e702e9a4912d86ddd7b3d17b8b992016417a32a800","question":"Will Ben McAdams be the Democratic nominee for UT-01?","description":"This market will resolve according to the candidate who wins the nomination for the Democratic Party to contest the UT-01 congressional district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections.

Orders that are blocked, enjoined, or otherwise prevented from taking effect by the deadline will not qualify.\n\nIf the policy is enacted through another official mechanism, including but not limited to a mayoral executive order, local legislation, or state law, and goes into effect by the resolution date it will qualify.\n\nOrders that apply only to one lease term (e.g., 0 % on one-year but \u003e 0 % on two-year), apply only to specific unit types (e.g., hotels or SROs), or relate to non-stabilized units will not qualify. Policies which include limited exceptions — such as exclusions for specific categories of rent-stabilized units (e.g., hardship exemptions, temporarily exempt buildings, or administrative carveouts) — will still qualify as long as a general policy of 0 % rent adjustment for both one-year and two-year renewal leases on rent-stabilized apartments and lofts is in effect citywide.\n\nIf Mamdani is confirmed to have lost the 2025 NYC Mayoral election by a consensus of credible reporting, this market will immediately resolve to “No.”\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be a consensus of credible reporting and official Rent Guidelines Board materials.","market_slug":"will-mamdani-freeze-nyc-rents-before-2027","end_date_iso":"2026-12-31T00:00:00Z","game_start_time":null,"seconds_delay":0,"fpmm":"","maker_base_fee":0,"taker_base_fee":0,"notifications_enabled":true,"neg_risk":false,"neg_risk_market_id":"","neg_risk_request_id":"","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-mamdani-freeze-nyc-rents-before-2027-EV0SF1Q62CPA.jpg","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/will-mamdani-freeze-nyc-rents-before-2027-EV0SF1Q62CPA.jpg","rewards":{"rates":[{"asset_address":"0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174","rewards_daily_rate":5}],"min_size":100,"max_spread":4.5},"is_50_50_outcome":false,"tokens":[{"token_id":"106102449360267073046637097096598048592436928340059823162151571020807191828087","outcome":"Yes","price":0.515,"winner":false},{"token_id":"86934023414665345422427506679433864279296027898426531732170959339104415335162","outcome":"No","price":0.485,"winner":false}],"tags":["Politics","New York City","NYC Mayor","Mamdani"]},{"enable_order_book":true,"active":true,"closed":false,"archived":false,"accepting_orders":true,"accepting_order_timestamp":"2025-11-12T21:28:27Z","minimum_order_size":5,"minimum_tick_size":0.01,"condition_id":"0xdb4d3985dac96597f4e7e518eb8c66ccb521d2ba2a1f2e387dc54ddff98b9025","question_id":"0x448c7312cdb7184bf7ccdb79ba564e81f56ffded784d3b914440245df62ac0e0","question":"Cerebras IPO before 2027?","description":"This market will resolve to \"Yes\" if the listed company completes an Initial Public Offering (IPO) by December 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, as confirmed by official company announcements or credible news sources.

Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”.\n\nThe primary source of resolution for this market will be the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), specifically the number of “Container Ships” reported in the SCA “Quarter Number \u0026 Net Ton by Ship Type” reports for Q1 \u0026 Q2 2026 (https://www.suezcanal.gov.eg/English/Navigation/Pages/NavigationStatistics.aspx). If this resolution source becomes unavailable, another SCA resolution source may be chosen. If the SCA does not publish specific data on the number of container ship transits of the Suez Canal for the first and second quarters of 2026, or for the first half of 2026, by September 1, 2026, 11:59 PM ET, credible third-party maritime data providers (e.g., IMF PortWatch, Clarkson Research, or Lloyd's List), citing SCA figures or satellite tracking data, will be used to determine the count, with the relevant time period being January 1, 2026 through June 30, 2026.","market_slug":"2k-container-ship-transits-of-suez-canal-in-h1-2026","end_date_iso":"2026-06-30T00:00:00Z","game_start_time":null,"seconds_delay":0,"fpmm":"","maker_base_fee":0,"taker_base_fee":0,"notifications_enabled":true,"neg_risk":false,"neg_risk_market_id":"","neg_risk_request_id":"","icon":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2k-container-ship-transits-of-suez-canal-in-h1-2026-J6xFRMAvFFDa.jpg","image":"https://polymarket-upload.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/2k-container-ship-transits-of-suez-canal-in-h1-2026-J6xFRMAvFFDa.jpg","rewards":{"rates":[{"asset_address":"0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174","rewards_daily_rate":2}],"min_size":100,"max_spread":4.5},"is_50_50_outcome":false,"tokens":[{"token_id":"32498176592183521901175008032097809808908848921141945570289489900415454617452","outcome":"Yes","price":0.17,"winner":false},{"token_id":"79985316868987169459058435056355705563488808481067503165033231805786693497113","outcome":"No","price":0.83,"winner":false}],"tags":["Middle East","Geopolitics","Economy","World"]},{"enable_order_book":true,"active":true,"closed":false,"archived":false,"accepting_orders":true,"accepting_order_timestamp":"2025-12-06T00:35:17Z","minimum_order_size":5,"minimum_tick_size":0.01,"condition_id":"0x30b8301e5003c810b41dd84cd3d4db213eeb4cc853f81996ebe9df5f425e058d","question_id":"0xf30b4e7d64b7840806b09666c1d48a561544c18eaca711a2b77a9098be192d00","question":"Will Chris Carr win the 2026 Georgia Governor Republican primary election?","description":"This market will resolve according to the winner of the Republican Primary for Governor of Georgia, scheduled to take place on May 19, 2026.
