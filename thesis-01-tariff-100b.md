## THESIS

### The Setup
The U.S. collected $82.2B in customs duties in FY2024. For FY2025 to exceed $100B, tariff revenue would need to increase by over 21% year-over-year despite only 4.5 months remaining in the fiscal year (ends Sep 30, 2025).

### Why the Market is (Probably) Right

**1. Time Constraints**
- FY2025 is ~62% complete (Oct 2024 - Feb 2026)
- Remaining time: ~7.5 months
- Tariff implementation has lag times

**2. Implementation Reality**
- New tariffs announced by Trump face legal challenges
- Customs systems take time to adjust
- Retaliation and trade negotiations create uncertainty

**3. Historical Baseline**
- $82.2B in FY2024
- Modest growth trajectory
- Even aggressive tariffs unlikely to spike revenue >21% in remaining months

### The Math

| Scenario | Probability | Payout | Contribution |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| Revenue <$100B (YES) | ~90% | $1.00 | $0.90 |
| Revenue >=$100B (NO) | ~10% | $0 | $0 |
| **Expected Value** | | | **$0.90** |

Market price: $0.854  
Expected value: $0.90  
**Edge: 5.4%**

After 2% Polymarket fee on winnings:  
Net edge: ~3.8% over 17 days = ~82% annualized

### Execution Plan

**Entry:** 
- BUY YES at 85¢ or better
- Place limit orders at 84-85¢
- Accept execution with 0.5% slippage

**Sizing:**
- Recommended: 2-3% of bankroll
- Rationale: Limited by $26K liquidity

**Exit:**
- Hold to resolution (Feb 28, 2026)
- Market resolves to YES: Collect $1.00 per share
- Market resolves to NO: Lose investment

### Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Sudden tariff escalation | Low | High | Position size limits |
| Treasury report delay | Medium | Low | Hold position |
| Data manipulation | Low | High | Multiple sources |
| Liquidity crunch | Medium | Medium | Limit order sizing |

### Catalysts

**Bullish for YES:**
- Legal challenges delay tariff implementation
- Trade negotiations reduce tariff rates
- Economic data shows modest customs growth

**Bearish for YES:**
- Emergency tariff declarations
- Retroactive tariff collection
- Treasury methodology changes

### Conclusion

This is a **consensus play** rather than a mispricing. The market has correctly identified the high probability that tariff revenue stays under $100B. The opportunity lies in capturing the risk premium (14% return) for tying up capital for 17 days.

**Action: BUY YES at 85¢ or better with 2-3% position size.**
