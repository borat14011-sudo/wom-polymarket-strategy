## THE MEDIA CYCLE FRAMEWORK

Every major news story follows a predictable emotional arc. Understanding this pattern creates edge.

## PHASE 1: BREAKING NEWS (T+0 to T+24h)

### Characteristics
- **Information asymmetry** — news breaking, not all market participants aware
- **High volatility** — wide spreads, fast moves
- **Emotional reactions** — panic/greed at extremes
- **Algorithmic trading** — bots responding to headlines

### Trading Rules

| Factor | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Direction** | Trade WITH the initial momentum (momentum is king) |
| **Entry** | Within first 30 minutes of headline breaking |
| **Position Size** | Small (25-33% of normal) — high uncertainty |
| **Stop Loss** | Tight (1-2% max) — news can reverse |
| **Target** | 5-15% move or 4-6 hours — whichever comes first |

### Entry Signals (GO LONG/SHORT)
- ✅ Headline breaks on primary sources (Reuters, Bloomberg, SEC filings)
- ✅ Volume spikes 300%+ above average
- ✅ Price breaks pre-news levels decisively
- ✅ Options IV explodes (but you're buying shares, not options)

### Exit Signals (GET OUT)
- 🛑 50% of initial move retraces
- 🛑 Counter-narrative emerges from credible source
- 🛑 Time stop: 6 hours max (overnight risk)
- 🛑 Target hit (take profit, don't be greedy)

### Risk Management
- **Never hold overnight** on Phase 1 trades
- **Use market orders sparingly** — spreads are wide, limit orders better
- **Check multiple sources** — verify headline isn't fake
- **Size down** — this is speculative by definition

### Example: Elon Twitter Acquisition (April 2022)
- T+0: $TWTR pops 5% on initial filing
- T+2hrs: Pumps 12% as details emerge
- **Trade**: Long on headline, out by +8% (missed peak, captured majority)

---

## PHASE 2: NARRATIVE FORMATION (T+1 to T+3 days)

### Characteristics
- **Media picks up story** — WSJ, CNBC, Bloomberg all covering
- **Analyst updates** — price targets revised
- **Pundits weigh in** — Twitter/X experts have opinions
- **Institutional flows** — larger players entering
- **Trend continuation** — momentum sustains

### Trading Rules

| Factor | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Direction** | Trade WITH the trend (trend is your friend) |
| **Entry** | Pullbacks to 20 EMA or 38.2% fib retracement |
| **Position Size** | Normal (50-75% of max position) |
| **Stop Loss** | Below the swing low or 20 EMA |
| **Target** | 15-30% move from entry, or Phase 3 signs |

### Entry Signals (RIDE THE WAVE)
- ✅ Story featured on CNBC/major financial media
- ✅ Analyst upgrades with price target increases
- ✅ Volume remains elevated (2x+ normal)
- ✅ Pullback finds support at key level
- ✅ Trend structure intact (higher lows)

### Exit Signals (PREPARE TO EXIT)
- 🛑 Media coverage saturates (every outlet has story)
- 🛑 Volume starts declining on rallies
- 🛑 Price makes parabolic move (>3 sigma day)
- 🛑 Everyone you know is talking about it
- 🛑 "This time is different" narratives emerge

### Risk Management
- **Trail stops** — lock in profits as move continues
- **Scale out** — take 1/3 off at +20%, 1/3 at +30%
- **Watch for false breaks** — retests of highs that fail
- **Correlation risk** — sector may move together (watch peers)

### Example: Trump Media (DJT) SPAC Merger
- T+1: +20% as details emerge
- T+2: +50% as political media covers extensively
- T+3: +100% (peak hype beginning)
- **Trade**: Entered T+1 pullback, scaled out through T+3

---

## PHASE 3: PEAK HYPE (T+3 to T+7 days)

### Characteristics
- **Saturated coverage** — every media outlet, every hour
- **Everyone has an opinion** — from your taxi driver to your dentist
- **Social media frenzy** — trending everywhere
- **Latecomer buying** — retail FOMO at maximum
- **Smart money distributing** — volume high, smart money selling

### Trading Rules

| Factor | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Direction** | FADE the hype (contrarian play) |
| **Entry** | Parabolic spike, exhaustion candles, divergence |
| **Position Size** | Normal to large (conviction trade) |
| **Stop Loss** | Above recent high (new hype high invalidates thesis) |
| **Target** | Retracement to 50% or 61.8% fib level |

### Entry Signals (SHORT THE HYPE)
- ✅ Stock is top story on CNBC for 3+ consecutive days
- ✅ Parabolic price action (5%+ moves daily)
- ✅ RSI > 80 on daily chart
- ✅ Volume declining on new highs (bearish divergence)
- ✅ Put/call ratio at extreme lows (complacency)
- ✅ Memes/cartoons about the stock circulating
- ✅ Your non-trading friends ask if they should buy

### Exit Signals (COVER SHORTS)
- 🛑 Retracement hits 50% or 61.8% fib level
- 🛑 Volume dries up completely (exhaustion)
- 🛑 New narrative emerges to replace old one
- 🛑 Short interest spikes (crowded short risk)
- 🛑 Time stop: 5 days max in Phase 3

### Risk Management
- **Never short into strength blindly** — wait for confirmation
- **Use options for shorts** — defined risk via puts
- **Position size carefully** — short squeezes are real
- **Have an exit plan before entering** — decide targets upfront

### Example: GameStop (GME) 2021 Squeeze
- T+5: Every media outlet covers "short squeeze"
- T+6: Elon tweets, Robinhood restricts buying
- T+7: Peak euphoria, then 60% crash in hours
- **Trade**: Short via puts after Robinhood news (defined risk)

### Example: Trump Indictment 1 (March 2023)
- T+0: DJT +15% on "martyrdom" narrative
- T+3: Media saturation, DJT +300% from lows
- T+5: Peak hype, everyone has opinion
- T+7: 40% drawdown from highs
- **Trade**: Short at media saturation, covered at -30%

---

## PHASE 4: EXHAUSTION (T+7+ days)

### Characteristics
- **Story gets old** — new headlines capture attention
- **Volume collapses** — no one cares anymore
- **Price reverts** — regression to mean
- **Bagholders remain** — retail stuck at highs
- **New narrative needed** — catalyst required for next move

### Trading Rules

| Factor | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Direction** | Mean reversion or range trading |
| **Entry** | Oversold bounces or range extremes |
| **Position Size** | Small — low conviction |
| **Stop Loss** | Tight — dead cats don't bounce twice |
| **Target** | Previous support/resistance or 20% move |

### Entry Signals (EXHAUSTION PLAYS)
- ✅ Volume drops 70%+ from peak
- ✅ Price stabilizes in range for 3+ days
- ✅ RSI back to neutral (40-60 range)
- ✅ No new headlines for 48+ hours
- ✅ Short covering rally potential

### Exit Signals (GET OUT)
- 🛑 Bounce fails at resistance
- 🛑 New news breaks (could restart cycle)
- 🛑 Volume remains anemic
- 🛑 Time stop: 3 days (dead money otherwise)

### Risk Management
- **Lowest conviction trades** — size accordingly
- **Mean reversion works until it doesn't** — tight stops
- **Watch for Phase 1 restart** — new catalyst = new cycle
- **Often better to skip** — capital preservation

## REAL EXAMPLES ANALYZED

### Example 1: Trump Indictments (Multiple Cycles)

**Cycle 1: March 2023 (Stormy Daniels)**
- T+0: DJT +15%
- T+3: DJT +50% (peak)
- T+7: DJT -40% from peak
- **Play**: Short at T+4 media saturation

**Cycle 2: June 2023 (Documents Case)**
- T+0: DJT +8%
- T+2: DJT +12%
- T+5: DJT -15% (faster exhaustion)
- **Play**: Shorter cycles on repeated narratives

**Pattern**: Subsequent indictments had SHORTER cycles (market adapts)

### Example 2: Elon Acquisitions

**Twitter (April 2022)**
- T+0: $TWTR +5% (initial)
- T+1: $TWTR +12% (confirmation)
- T+7: $TWTR +25% (deal price)
- **Play**: Long Phase 1-2, flat Phase 3 (deal certainty)

**Pattern**: Known acquisition price = limited Phase 3

### Example 3: Crypto Exchange Launches

**Coinbase IPO (April 2021)**
- T+0: $COIN opens $381, hits $429
- T+1: Descends to $328
- T+7: $310 (continued fade)
- **Play**: Short Phase 1 exhaustion (IPO hype)

**Pattern**: IPOs often skip Phase 2, go straight to Phase 3/4

### Example 4: Political Debates

**Trump-Biden Debate (June 2024)**
- T+0: $DJT -15% (perceived poor performance)
- T+1: -5% (narrative forms: "is he fit?")
- T+3: Biden drops out, $DJT +40%
- **Play**: Event-driven, news invalidates pattern

**Pattern**: Political events can create NEW cycles from old ones

## ENTRY/EXIT FRAMEWORK

### The Media Cycle Checklist

Before every trade, ask:

**Phase Identification:**
- [ ] What time since news broke?
- [ ] How saturated is media coverage?
- [ ] What is the prevailing narrative?
- [ ] Where is volume vs. average?

**Entry Confirmation:**
- [ ] Does entry match phase rules?
- [ ] Is risk defined (stop loss set)?
- [ ] Is position size appropriate?
- [ ] Is target realistic?

**Exit Plan:**
- [ ] Where do I take profits (1/2/3)?
- [ ] Where is my stop loss?
- [ ] What invalidates my thesis?
- [ ] Maximum hold time?

### The "Saturation Test"

Before fading (shorting) in Phase 3:

1. **Count the headlines** — 10+ major outlets in 24h = saturated
2. **Check social media** — trending on X for 2+ days = saturated
3. **Survey your network** — non-traders mentioning it = saturated
4. **Analyst notes** — multiple upgrades in 48h = saturated

If 3/4 hit: **SATURATED** → Contrarian fade is on

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Phase 1 Mistakes
- ❌ Fading the initial move (don't fight news)
- ❌ Holding overnight (gap risk)
- ❌ Trusting one source (verify headlines)
- ❌ Oversizing (this is gambling with edge)

### Phase 2 Mistakes
- ❌ Chasing parabolic moves (wait for pullback)
- ❌ Ignoring volume (declining volume = warning)
- ❌ Marrying the narrative (trade the price)
- ❌ Not scaling out (greedy = give back profits)

### Phase 3 Mistakes
- ❌ Shorting too early (wait for saturation)
- ❌ Using too much size (short squeezes hurt)
- ❌ Ignoring "this time is different" (it's never different)
- ❌ Not respecting new highs (thesis invalidation)

### Phase 4 Mistakes
- ❌ Trying to catch falling knives
- ❌ Averaging down on losing positions
- ❌ Expecting old catalysts to reactivate
- ❌ Trading dead names (opportunity cost)

## ADVANCED TACTICS

### 1. Cross-Asset Media Cycles

When a stock dominates headlines, trade the derivatives:

| Primary | Derivative Play | Phase Application |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| TSLA news | Short TSLA calls (sell premium) | Phase 3 |
| Crypto news | Long COIN/MSTR | Phase 2 |
| EV news | Long lithium miners | Phase 2 |
| AI news | Long data center REITs | Phase 2 |

### 2. Options Strategies by Phase

| Phase | Strategy | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Phase 1 | Long stock (not options) | IV too high |
| Phase 2 | Long calls (OTM) | Momentum continuation |
| Phase 3 | Long puts / Short calls | Vol crush + price fade |
| Phase 4 | Iron condors | Range bound, vol crush |

### 3. The "Media Divergence" Trade

When price and media sentiment diverge:
- **Price up + sentiment turning negative** = Hidden distribution (short)
- **Price down + sentiment turning positive** = Accumulation (long)

Use tools like:
- Google Trends (search interest)
- Social sentiment APIs
- Media mention counts

### 4. Cycle Within Cycle

Major stories have sub-cycles:

```
Main Story: Trump Legal Issues (multi-week cycle)
├── Sub-cycle 1: Indictment #1 (1 week)
├── Sub-cycle 2: Indictment #2 (5 days)
├── Sub-cycle 3: Trial date set (3 days)
└── Sub-cycle 4: Verdict (1 day)
```

Each sub-cycle follows the 4-phase framework but compressed.

## FINAL THOUGHTS

The media cycle is a behavioral edge that persists because:

1. **Humans are emotional** — Fear and greed never change
2. **Information diffuses slowly** — Not everyone reacts at once
3. **Institutions are slow** — They can't pivot as fast as you
4. **Narratives have momentum** — Stories take time to peak

**The edge isn't in the information — it's in understanding how others will react to it.**

Trade the cycle. Manage risk. Compound gains.
