- Trading bot uses wallet: `0xb354e25623617a24164639F63D8b731250AC92d8`
- **These are different!** Need private key for Polymarket wallet.

**TAKE SCREENSHOT SHOWING:**

- **Private key** (starts with `0x` followed by 64 hex characters)

### 5. Send to Me
Send the screenshot with private key visible.

## What Happens Next:

Once I have the private key:

1. **Update bot configuration** to use correct wallet
2. **Check if wallet has USDC** (might already have $10!)
3. **Execute test trade** immediately
4. **Deploy automated trading**

## Alternative (If Private Key Not Available):

If you can't get the private key:

1. **Fund wallet `0xb354e256...` with $10 USDC**
2. **Create new Polymarket account** with that wallet
3. **Use existing bot configuration**

## Security Note:

**DO NOT** share private key in plain text. Use screenshot only.
**DO NOT** send private key via unencrypted channels.
**DO** delete screenshot after I confirm receipt.

## Expected Private Key Format:

```
0x + 64 hexadecimal characters
Example: 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
```

## Time Estimate:

- Getting private key: 2 minutes
- Bot update: 1 minute
- Test trade: 30 seconds
- **Total to first trade: <5 minutes**

**This is the FINAL BLOCKER before automated trading begins!** 🚀
