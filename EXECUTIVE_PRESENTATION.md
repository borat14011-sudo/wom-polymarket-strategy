## 💡 CRITICAL LEARNINGS

### **What Works:**
1. **Event-driven patterns** beat price-based strategies
2. **Extreme probability fading** (betting against 90%+ consensus)
3. **High-frequency execution** (52+ cycles/year for maximum IRR)
4. **Multi-agent validation** prevents single-point failures
5. **Kelly criterion sizing** optimizes risk-adjusted returns

### **What Doesn't Work:**
1. Price momentum/trend following (95%+ win rates were fake)
2. Low liquidity markets (<$5K volume)
3. Long-duration positions (>30 days degrade edge)
4. Strategies without transaction cost modeling (5% fees destroy edges)
5. Correlated position clusters (need diversification)

### **Key Insight:**
> "Markets are predictable through REPEATING EVENT PATTERNS, not price patterns. Every government shutdown threat spikes then fades - that's tradeable."
