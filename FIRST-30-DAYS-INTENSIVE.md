## 🚨 COMMON FIRST-MONTH CHALLENGES

### Challenge 1: "Nobody's watching my videos"
**Normal views for beginners:** 20-200 per video  
**Fix:** Keep posting. Algorithm needs data (20+ posts) to understand your content.  
**Mindset:** Every creator started here.

### Challenge 2: "I feel stupid filming myself"
**Normal:** Yes, it's weird at first!  
**Fix:** Film 10 videos. By video 10, it feels less awkward.  
**Remember:** Confidence comes from repetition, not from feeling confident first.

### Challenge 3: "I don't know what to post"
**Fix:** Answer questions from your DMs  
**Or:** "10 things I wish I knew about [topic]"  
**Or:** Review the 100+ topic ideas in 90-DAY-CONTENT-CALENDAR-TEMPLATE.md

### Challenge 4: "Someone left a mean comment"
**Fix:** Delete + block  
**Or:** Reply with kindness (kills them with kindness)  
**Remember:** Haters watch too (views count!). Develop thick skin.

### Challenge 5: "I'm not growing fast enough"
**Reality check:** 100 followers in Month 1 is GOOD  
**Most accounts:** 0-50 followers Month 1  
**Your account:** Growing? You're doing great.

**Week 2:** Still hard, but less scary (progress)  
**Week 3:** Starting to feel natural (momentum)  
**Week 4:** You have a SYSTEM (transformation)

**Most people:**
- Day 1: Excited!
- Day 7: This is harder than I thought...
- Day 14: I don't see results... (quit)

**You:**
- Day 1: Excited!
